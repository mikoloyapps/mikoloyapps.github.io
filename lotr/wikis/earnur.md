<53>**Eärnur** was the thirty-third and last King of Gondor until the accession of Aragorn II Elessar. He took the throne upon the death of his father Eärnil II in TA 2043, and after his disappearance the Stewards of Gondor ruled in his name for many generations.

# History
---

<53>Eärnur was the son of Eärnil II. He was a great warrior and became a great leader of armies before he became King. His greatest victory was against Angmar in TA 1975 in the Battle of Fornost, in which he defeated the Witch-king, whom he intended to slay had his steed not panicked in terror of the Witch-king's darkness. It was to him that Glorfindel stated his prophecy that "not by the hand of men shall he fall" referring to the Witch-king as he fled from defeat. After becoming King in TA 2043, he was challenged by the Witch-king of Angmar, chief of the Ringwraiths, who then resided in Minas Morgul. Eärnur, being quick to anger and wrath, would have accepted his challenge had the wise Steward Mardil Voronwë not held him back, and so the first challenge went unanswered.

<53>In TA 2050 a second challenge came, mocking Eärnur for his supposed cowardice in the face of the Witch-king at the Battle of Fornost, and Mardil was not able to stop Eärnur from accepting the challenge. After entering the gates of Minas Morgul with a small escort, Eärnur was never heard from again. His crown lay on his father's tomb in the Hallows of Minas Tirith.

<53>The Line of Anárion was broken with Eärnur's disappearance, and the rule of Gondor passed to the Stewards, beginning with Mardil Voronwë, who had tried to restrain Eärnur from going to Minas Morgul to face the Witch-king. The Stewards were to rule "until the King returns", for it was then unknown whether Eärnur had been killed duelling the Witch-king or not. Eärnur had also left without naming an heir, and while many nobles in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the kingship, no claim would be accepted by all, and no one wanted to risk a second civil war.
