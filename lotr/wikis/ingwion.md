# History
---

<53>Ingwion was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees. When he and his kindred came to Aman they first dwelt in Tirion, but soon came to love the full light of the Two Trees and relocated to Valinor at the base of Taniquetil. Ingwion likely lived there for many years with his father. He went to Middle-earth with the Host of Valinor for the War of Wrath in FA 545, capturing Eglarest in the first battle of the war.

<53>He had siblings, and was a cousin of Indis, wife of the Ñoldorin king Finwë.

# Etymology

<53>Ingwion is a compound of his father's name Ingwë and the Quenya patronymic suffix -ion, wherefore his name means "Son of Ingwë".
