#### Dáin's Halls

# History
---

<53>Dáin I's reign was plagued by attacks from dragons in the Grey Mountains. In TA 2589, Dáin I and his second son Frór were slain at the doors of their hall by a Cold-drake. He was the last King of Durin's Folk to live in the Grey Mountains; shortly after Dáin I was laid to rest in the tombs of the mountain halls, the Grey Mountains were abandoned by the Dwarves.

<53>Dáin I was succeeded by his son Thrór, who returned to the Lonely Mountain and unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim Moria. His younger son Grór founded his own realm in the Iron Hills.
