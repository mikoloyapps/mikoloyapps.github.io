<53>**Wargs** were a breed of wolves who lived in the Misty Mountains. Some were captured and used by Orcs of Isengard and Mordor in the Third Age, and others had an allegiance with the northern goblins. They appear first in The Hobbit, attacking Thorin and Company as they traveled east from the Misty Mountains.

#### A Warg eyeing Gimli in Peter Jackson's films

<53>In Théoden's retreat to Helm's Deep from the threat of Isengard in TA 3019, a scout reported that "wolf-riders" were abroad in the valley, but Wargs were not specifically mentioned.

#### Azog's female white Warg

<53>In TA 2941, a pack of Wargs planned to meet the goblins of the Misty Mountains and organize a raid on several nearby villages, to expel the Woodmen and capture some slaves. As the pack approached the meeting-place east of the mountains, they happened upon Thorin's Company along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, who had just escaped from the same goblins. Gandalf had anticipated this, suggesting the Company climb up a nearby stand of trees. This was done, and Dori helped Bilbo out of the Wargs' reach just in time.

#### A Warg pack in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

<53>Thinking the Dwarves allies of the Woodmen, the Wargs surrounded the glade and prevented them from descending. Gandalf lit up pine-cones and hurled them against the Wargs, until they were driven out. The wolves that had caught fire fled into the forest and had set it alight in several places, as it was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Goblins soon appeared, and set the trees on fire. Not long after the Great Eagles arrived and rescued the Company.

<53>Not long after the news of Smaug’s death spread throughout Middle-earth, Wargs and goblins united to claim the Lonely Mountain as their own, but were defeated by an alliance of Dwarves, Elves, Lake-men, and Great Eagles in the Battle of Five Armies.

#### A Warg as seen in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

<53>Decades later, on January 13 of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring was attacked by a group of Wargs, presumably sent by Saruman to waylay them after the failed attempt to cross the Redhorn Pass. The Wargs fled after their first assault, but returned with reinforcements. Eventually, this second assault also failed, and by morning the Fellowship noticed that the carcasses of the slain had vanished. Aragorn knew them to be from "the mountains".
