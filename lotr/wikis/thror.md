<53>**Thrór I** was King of Durin's Folk, the son of Dáin I and brother of Frór and Grór, known for ruling Erebor in the Lonely Mountain. He was the father of Thráin II, whose son was Thorin II Oakenshield.

# History
---

<53>In his early life, Thrór and his family lived in the dragon-plagued Grey Mountains. In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by Cold-drakes, his father Dáin I and younger brother Frór were both slain at their gates by a great Cold-drake, and Thrór inherited the kingship. He and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Thrór led a small portion of Durin's Folk to recolonize Erebor, taking the Arkenstone with him. Grór led the other portion of Durin's Folk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his realm.

<53>Under Thrór's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century. Eventually the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the dragon known as Smaug, who flew south and destroyed the kingdom, killing hundreds of Dwarves and driving away Thrór and his family, as well as thousands of other surviving Dwarves. The majority of the survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thrór, his son Thráin II, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield west into a long and homeless wandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland where they made a living as best they could.

<53>Twenty years later in TA 2790, Thrór now old, poor, and desperate, gave to his son Thráin II the last of the Seven Rings, a key and map of the Lonely Mountain. He then left his people and journeyed away north with a single companion called Nár. They crossed over the Misty Mountains through the Redhorn Pass and then came south again, crossing the Silverlode into the valley of Azanulbizar beneath the East-gate of Moria. When they arrived, the gate was open. Nár begged Thrór to beware but Thrór disregarded his pleas and proudly entered Moria as its returning heir, but he did not come back.

<53>Nár waited and hid nearby for many days. One day he heard a great shout, followed by the blast of a horn, and a body was flung out onto the steps. It was indeed the body of Thrór, as Nár had feared. Then a voice called out to him from just inside the gate. Rather than being killed as well, Nár was instead made use of as a messenger. He was told to deliver a warning that 'beggars' who would not wait at the doors but instead entered to attempt thieving, would meet a similar fate. Nár was told to bring this message back to his people. But that was not all: the voice proclaimed that he now ruled Moria, and if any wanted to know who was king, he had written his name on the beggar's face. Thrór's head lay severed next to his body. Nár turned it over and found branded across the forehead, written in Dwarven runes, a name that would be branded in the hearts of all Dwarves: Azog. He was barred from retrieving the head of Thrór and was struck with a pouch containing a few coins of little worth, which Azog referred to as a 'fee', but it was meant as a final insulting gesture. Nár took the pouch and fled down the Silverlode. When he looked back, Orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart Thrór's body and flinging the pieces to the black crows.

<53>This was the tale that Nár brought back to Thráin II when he returned to Dunland weeks later. After seven days of sitting in silent grief, Thráin at last stood up and declared that this atrocity would be answered. This was the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, although it took up three years for the Dwarves to gather their full forces. The war culminated with the Battle of Azanulbizar, which, though costly, was won by the Dwarves, and Dáin Ironfoot, son of Náin, beheaded Azog and mounted the Orc's head on a stick. The pouch of coins originally flung at Nár was stuffed into Azog's mouth.

## **Legacy**

<53>Thrór's map, which he had made at some point prior to his death, was eventually passed to his grandson Thorin II Oakenshield by the wizard Gandalf through Thrór's son, Thráin, during the latter's imprisonment at Dol Guldur. This map was translated by Elrond, and utilized by Thorin's company in the year TA 2941 to reclaim Erebor from Smaug.
