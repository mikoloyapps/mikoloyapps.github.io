<53>The boys lived peacefully with their father and mother in Menegroth until the dreaded Oath of Fëanor descended on Doriath due to Dior's failure to turn over the Silmaril under the threat of war. When the Sons of Fëanor attacked, the twins were seized by the cruel servants of Celegorm and abandoned in the forest to die. However, Maedhros, the eldest of the Sons of Fëanor, bitterly regretted this deed and sought for them in vain in the surrounding forest.

<53>They were never found and were presumed to have perished in the forest. Tradition among the Nandor of Ossiriand held that they were led to the safety of the woodlands by birds and beasts and thereby survived.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Elurín was a Sindarin word that means "Remembrance of Elu", which came from the words Elu, which was another name for Thingol, and ren ("recall, have in mind").

<53>Eluréd has less clear origins. The latter element réd may have come from the Bëorian word rêda ("heir").
