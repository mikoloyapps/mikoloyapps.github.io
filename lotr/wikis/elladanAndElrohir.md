<53>**Elladan** and **Elrohir** were the twin sons of Elrond the Half-elven and Celebrían of Rivendell, and were noted for their close friendship and cooperation with the Dúnedain of the North, Rangers of the North, and Men in general, and for their deeds during the War of the Ring.

# History
---

## **Third Age**

<53>Elladan and Elrohir were born in TA 130, and had a younger sister, Arwen. Through their mother Celebrían, they were the only grandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlórien.

<53>In TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment by Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and torment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she departed for the Undying Lands the next year. Due to this, the twins harbored great hatred for Orcs.

<53>By the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with Arathorn II, the father of Aragorn II Elessar. There Arathorn was slain and his wife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as his foster-son, naming him Estel.

## War of the Ring

<53>When the Fellowship of the Ring formed in Rivendell, the twins' role was to scout the lands and prepare the way for the Fellowship. Later, they traveled along with Halbarad and the Grey Company. They delivered a message from their father concerning the Paths of the Dead and accompanied Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli there. Elladan traveled behind the company, the Dead following after him. They battled on the Fields of Pelennor "with stars bound to their brows."

#### Elladan and Elrohir

<53>During the Last Debate, Elladan and Elrohir seconded Gandalf's decision to throw a force at the Morannon, saying that Elrond had sent them with that same counsel from Rivendell. Elladan and Elrohir then accompanied Aragorn and fought alongside him at the Battle of the Black Gate.

## After the War

<53>After the war, Elladan and Elrohir met the escort of Arwen in Lothlórien, and together, they traveled to Minas Tirith. The brothers arrived first and carried a banner of silver. They were followed by Glorfindel and Erestor.

## **Fourth Age and beyond**

<53>When their father departed to the West, the brothers stayed in Rivendell for a while. In time, their grandfather Celeborn came to live with them before journeying to the Grey Havens. It is unknown whether Elladan and Elrohir chose to remain in Middle-earth as mortal men or depart with the last of their kindred to Valinor.

# Character

---

<53>Though Tolkien never specifically states that Elrohir and Elladan were twins, it is suspected that they were for four reasons: first, they are described as "So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey" (Tolkien 761). Secondly, one is rarely mentioned without the other, and their names are only separated when they are speaking. Thirdly, they were both born in the same year, and elven pregnancies last a full year. Fourthly, the birth of twins was not a rare occurrence in their family history (Amrod and Amras, Eluréd and Elurín, Elrond and Elros).

<53>The brethren were friends and companions-in-arms of the Rangers of the North, and helped defend the remnants of Arnor from evil after the fall of the North-kingdom. They held a special grudge against Orcs because of their mother's suffering at their hands.

#### Elrohir from The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game

<53>Like their sister, father, and uncle, they could make a choice between mortality and immortality, expressed by whether they would follow their father to Valinor at the time of his own departure at the end of the Third Age. Since they are explicitly described as remaining in Rivendell for a time after their father's departure, some fans speculated that they had also chosen mortality. However, J.R.R. Tolkien himself noted that the twins were allowed to "delay" their choices.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Elladan is Sindarin for "Elf-Man" or "Elf-Dúnadan," referring to his dual descent from both Elves and Edain (a name given to those descending from the three houses of Men from Beleriand). It comes from the words el ("elf or star") and adan, singular of Edain. On the other hand, Elrohir means "Elf-knight", but rochir also means "horse-lord".
