<53>**Celebrimbor** was a Ñoldorin prince and the last in the line of the House of Fëanor, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Eregion in the Second Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his creation of the Three Rings of Power: Nenya, Vilya, and Narya, but also he made the second Elfstone (in one version) for Galadriel, who later gave it to Aragorn.

# History
---

## **First Age**

<53>Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel) and Nerdanel. In the First Age, he fought in the battles of Dagor-nuin-Giliath and Dagor Aglareb. After fighting in the Dagor Bragollach, he lived with his father and uncle in Nargothrond, staying even after Curufin's exile. He later escaped the Sack of Nargothrond, and traveled to Gondolin. He would fight in and survive the Fall of Gondolin. Unlike some of his kin, he remained in Middle-earth afterwards.

## **Second Age**

<53>Celebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing with the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling himself Annatar ("Lord of Gifts"), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and instructed them in the art of ring-making. Celebrimbor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Celebrimbor himself forged the three Elven rings without assistance from Sauron. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding magic into the rings.

<53>In secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence over those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water, respectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to Durin III of Khazad-dûm.

<53>Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Sauron attacked the Grey Havens. He was the last direct descendant of the line of Fëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate is unknown and is said by some legends to still wander the shores of the Sea. It is unknown whether he married, no children are recorded.

# Etymology

---

<53>His father-name was Telperinquar, which means "Silver-fist" or "Hand of silver" in Quenya. It comes from the words telpë ("silver") and quár ("fist"). His mother-name is untold. The name Celebrimbor is the Sindarin translation of his father-name, of the roots celeb ("silver") and baur ("fist").

# Character

---

<53>Unlike both his father and grandfather, Celebrimbor was selfless and kind, and neither prideful nor covetous of what he created. He was described to have an "almost Dwarvish obsession with crafts"; he became a famous artificer and smith in both Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion, where he was introduced to a precious metal which he called mithril. Mithril was mined by Dwarves in nearby Khazad-dûm, later named Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed, and skills and secrets were shared between Moria and Eregion for many years via the high road. But a long period of peace would not last, for upon realizing the trap which Sauron had devised for him, Celebrimbor was filled with anxiety and fear for his people, and was later described as the heroic defender of Eregion.
