#### Amrod and Amras

<53>In accordance to The Silmarillion, Amrod did not die during the Burning of the ships at Losgar. In this version, Amrod and his six brothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath.

# Etymology

---

<53>Amrods father-name is Telufinwë "Last Finwë", most likely from the Quenyan tella ("hindmost, last"). The short form of this name is Telvo. Originally, his mother-name was Ambarussa "Top-russet", from amba ("upwards"). When Fëanor insisted on different names for the twins, Nerdanel called Amrod Umbarto, "the Fated". Fëanor later changed it to Ambarto, "Upwards-exalted", from amba and arta ("exalted, lofty").
