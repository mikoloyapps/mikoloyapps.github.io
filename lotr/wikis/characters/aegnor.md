<53>**Aegnor** was a Ñoldorin Elf, the third son of Finarfin, elder brother of Galadriel, younger brother of Finrod Felagund and Angrod and lord of the Ñoldor of Dorthonion in the First Age.

# History
---

<53>Aegnor was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. When Fëanor spoke in Tirion, Aegnor was moved by his words as was his brother but neither spoke against their father; however, he and his brothers followed the host of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he together with Angrod held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth throughout the time of the Siege of Angband.

<53>Aegnor never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman Andreth, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing Men and Elves and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in the Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth. However, it was wartime and he did not make his intentions towards her clear enough. He was killed along with his brother soon after when Morgoth broke the Siege at the start of Dagor Bragollach in FA 455.
