<53>**Mahtan** was a renowned Ñoldorin metallurgist of Aman and the father of Nerdanel, the wife of Fëanor.

# History
---

<53>Mahtan was a skilled smith in Valinor who learned the arts of metal and stonework under direction of the Vala Aulë.[2] He wore a copper circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for metal above gold. Mahtan passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and son-in-law, Fëanor, who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of all Elven craftsmen. When Fëanor and certain Ñoldor became more proud and suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Melkor, and began forging armaments for what would be Valinor's first war, Mahtan came to regret teaching him. Later, Nerdanel became estranged from Fëanor and retired back to Mahtan's house. The servants of Aulë counselled against joining the Revolt of the Ñoldor, and therefore Mahtan chose not to rebel, and remained in Valinor in peace forever after.

#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>Mahtan had a beard, which was unusual for an Elf, especially a young one. J.R.R. Tolkien tells that Elves could only grow beards from the "third cycle" of their lives, while Mahtan was an exception, being only early in his second cycle. It is unclear what these "cycles" actually refer to.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Mahtan might be from the Quenya mahta- ("to handle"), referring to the arts and skill of making. His devotion to Aulë had earned him the name Aulëndur ("Servant of Aulë") from -ndur ("to serve"). The earlier form of this name was Aulëndil, which was later used by Sauron during his treachery to Númenor.

<53>Mahtan's other name Urundil means "Copper-lover" from urun ("copper") and -ndil ("lover, friend"). His alternate epessë, Rusco, meant "Fox", a reference to his red-brown hair.
