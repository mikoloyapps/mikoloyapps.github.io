#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>In 472 of the First Age, Gwindor was captured during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad by Morgoth, and when he returned in FA 490 he came with a companion who called himself Agarwaen son of Umarth (the Bloodstained, son of Ill-Fate). Unbeknownst to Finduilas, this was actually Túrin, son of Húrin. Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, Finduilas fell in love with Túrin, but Túrin refused her in respect for his friend. Gwindor realized this, and revealed Túrin's name to Finduilas and tried to let Túrin fall in love with Finduilas, since he realized Finduilas loved Túrin instead of him.

<53>After the failure of the Battle of Tumhalad, Glaurung and an army of Orcs sacked Nargothrond. Gwindor was slain and when Túrin returned to Nargothrond he was caught in a trance by the dragon who spoke to him of his kin in Hithlum, rendering him deaf to the cries of Finduilas as a party of Orcs dragged her past him as a captive intended for Angband.

<53>Glaurung's deceit caused Túrin to abandon Finduilas and instead go to Hithlum in search of his kin. By the time he finally went to search for Finduilas she was dead, for she had been killed when the Orcs guarding her were waylaid by the Haladin of Brethil at the Crossings of Taeglin. Before their defeat the Orcs had killed all their captives, nailing Finduilas to a tree with a spear. The people of Haladin buried her in a mound they called Haudh-en-Elleth, Mound of the Elf-maiden.

# Etymology

<53>The name Finduilas comes from the Sindarin elements fin ("hair"), a common prefix in the House of Finwë, duil, which may have come from the ethuil ("spring"), and las ("leaf").

<53>Her epessë Faelivrin means "Gleam of the Sun on the Pools of Ivrin" from the Sindarin fael ("gleam, brilliance").
