<53>The **Nandor** (Quenya; singular Nando) were Elves of Telerin descent, who left the Great Journey from Cuiviénen to Valinor as the Elves reached the Misty Mountains.

# History
---

<53>The Nandor began under the Teleri Elf Lenwë, whose name in their language was Denweg. He led a group that turned south along the river Anduin, and disappeared from written history. Many years later a group of Nandor under Denethor, son of Lenwë, hearing of a great Elven realm crossed the Blue Mountains into Ossiriand. When they first arrived into Beleriand, the Nandor still called themselves Lindai, the old clan name for the Teleri, though it had become Lindi in their tongue. The Sindar welcomed them as kin and at first, called them Lindil after what the Nandor called themselves, Lindi. Eventually this became Laegel, which means Green-Elf. The Quenya translation of this is Laiquendi.

<53>In later years, the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlórien were descended from the Nandor (but most of their lords were not), as were the Elves who dwelt at Edhellond near Dol Amroth during the early days of Gondor.

# Language

---

<53>The original Nandorin language gradually disappeared from Middle-earth after the end of the First Age, when Sindarin Elves merged with the Silvan folk and were taken as their lords. Nandorin/Silvan gradually became extinct, surviving only in place names such as "Laurelindórinan/Lindórinand" (old names for the land of Lothlórien) and proper names such as Amroth. The daily tongue of the Silvan elves became Sindarin, or Sindarin with some Silvan influences.

# Etymology

---

<53>Nandor is the Quenya term, meaning 'those who turn back'.
