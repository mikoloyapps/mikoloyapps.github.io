> *"Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more, they too may walk again."*
>> \- Gandalf explaining the Nazgûl to Frodo

<53>The **Nazgûl** (Black Speech for **"Ringwraiths"**) or **Úlairi**, also known as the **Black Riders** or simply **The Nine**, were the dreaded ring-servants of the Dark Lord Sauron in Middle-earth throughout the Second and Third Ages, who in the later years of the Third Age dwelt in Minas Morgul and Dol Guldur.

#### Kings of Men with their Rings of Power, as seen in The Lord of the Rings

<53>Nineteen Rings of Power were made in Eregion, forged by Celebrimbor. These were locked away in one of the safes of Eregion, but all were captured by Sauron. He gave nine of them to great lords and warriors of Men, including three Númenóreans, and one Easterling king. Sauron succeeded in corrupting the powerful Nine through his dominance over the rings. These Nine used the rings to achieve great power, wealth, and prestige in life, but as time passed the Rings continued to exert a corrupting influence. The Rings eventually rendered their bearers invisible to all but those who could see into the wraith world, and enslaved them to the will of Sauron. Their lives and their powers became bound to Sauron's via the One Ring; as Sauron grew or diminished, so too did the Nazgûl.

<53>Three of the Ringwraiths may have been among the first and most powerful Númenóreans to be corrupted by Sauron, a thousand years before the Downfall: they revered Sauron, and became ensnared in his designs because of their lust for power or knowledge.

<53>Only two of the Nine were ever named: the Witch-king of Angmar and Khamûl the Easterling.

![](nazgul/3.jpg)

<53>The Nine were first observed around 2251 of the Second Age, and soon became Sauron's primary servants. Despite their great power and position as instruments of Sauron's will, not much is known of their activities during the Second Age. They were temporarily dispersed after Sauron's downfall in SA 3434 in the War of the Last Alliance. Though no longer able to maintain physical form, just as Sauron was after losing the One Ring, both the Nazgûl and Sauron were able to endure as long as the Ring survived.

## **Return of the Nazgûl**

![](nazgul/4.jpg)

#### The Witch-king's true undead appearance as depicted in Peter Jackson's films

<53>The Nazgûl re-emerged around 1300 of the Third Age, as Sauron at long last began to take shape after his defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance. It was around this time that the Witch-king established himself in Angmar (thus gaining his title) and began to launch attacks against the nearby kingdom of Arnor, which had fractured into three smaller kingdoms. His first target was the realm of Rhudaur. After suborning Rhudaur and replacing the Dúnedain king with one of the native Hill-men, in the year TA 1356 the Witch-king moved against Arthedain, resulting in the death of King Argeleb I.

<53>But Arthedain was not yet defeated, and it managed to maintain a line of defense along the Weather Hills. In TA 1409 came the attack on Cardolan. Also during this time, the forces of the Witch-king burned and destroyed the watchtower of Amon Sûl. After the fall of Cardolan, Angmar's advance was slowed by resistance from the Elves of Lindon, Lothlórien and Rivendell. By TA 1974, Angmar attacked again and captured Arthedain's capital of Fornost, and with that, the last kingdom of Arnor was destroyed.

![](nazgul/6.jpg)

#### The Witch-king, Lord of the Nazgûl, as seen in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

<53>A year later, Eärnur, prince of Gondor, arrived with the intention of aiding Arthedain. However, Eärnur arrived too late to be of help in defending Arnor's territories, and his army sought revenge against the Witch-king instead. His forces marched against the armies of the Witch-king and utterly destroyed them during the Battle of Fornost. With the destruction of his forces and his task in the north complete, the Witch-king fled. Despite the complete annihilation of Angmar, the campaign was accounted a tremendous success by Sauron: the territories formerly occupied by Arnor became essentially wilderness, and the remaining Dúnedain Rangers of the North were no threat to Sauron's plans.

<53>By TA 1980 Gondor's watch on Mordor had failed and the Witch-king was able to return there and gather the other eight Nazgûl. In the year TA 2000 they attacked, and after a siege lasting two years they conquered the city of Minas Ithil (which then became known as Minas Morgul), acquiring a palantír for the Dark Lord in the process. It was from Minas Morgul that the Nine directed the rebuilding of Sauron's armies and the preparation of Mordor for their master's return. In TA 2942 Sauron returned to Mordor, openly declaring himself in TA 2951. He sent three of the Nazgûl to re-occupy his fortress of Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. They were led by Khamûl, the second most powerful of the Nazgûl behind the Witch-king.

## **Hunt for the Ring**

## Search for the Shire

![](nazgul/5.jpg)

#### The Nine leaving Minas Morgul

<53>A few years before the War of the Ring, Gollum, a Stoor who had once owned the One Ring, was captured and tortured in Mordor. From him, Sauron learned the family name of the Ring's bearer and the fact that he lived in a land called the Shire. Sauron wasted no time in attempting to capture the Ring, sending all of the Nine to retrieve it on July 1, TA 3018. Gollum had claimed that the Halflings' homeland was in the Vales of Anduin. On this information, after Mordor had captured eastern Osgiliath from the Men of Gondor, the Nazgûl crossed secretly at night and passed through Anórien, up the Vale of Entwash, and into the Wold, relatively unnoticed. They arrived at the west shore of Anduin, north of Sarn Gebir, and received horses and clothes on July 17. On July 22, they met the Nazgûl from Dol Guldur on the Field of Celebrant. From them they learned that no halflings had lived in the Vales of Anduin for many years and that Gollum, having been re-captured by Sauron's Orcs, had escaped them and the Woodland Elves. However, knowing no better counsel, they continued riding north in the land between Lothlórien and the Misty Mountains, but failed to learn anything and returned south. Upon their return to the Wold in September, messengers from Barad-dûr gave them terrible threats from Sauron, and also news that Saruman might have the location of the Shire. As ordered by Sauron, they rode to Isengard openly through Rohan at great speed, causing many to flee in terror.

![](nazgul/8.jpg)

#### The Nine crossing the Ford of Bruinen

<53>When they arrived at Isengard two days after Gandalf's escape, Saruman shut the gates and used his voice to claim he didn't have the Ring or knowledge of its location, but that Gandalf knew where it was. The riders then began to pursue Gandalf in Rohan, where they found and interrogated Gríma Wormtongue. From him they learned the location of the Shire, but let him go both because of his fear of them and his ability to do more evil against Saruman. Another account claims he only realized Gandalf's escape once the Riders arrived and he wished to seek pardon from him. Saruman revealed the Shire's location in hate, claiming Gandalf had been forced to tell him.

<53>In all accounts they divided into pairs, then crossed the Isen and rode north through the wastelands of Enedwaith. Near Tharbad, they captured a spy of Saruman who was purchasing goods from the Bracegirdles and had detailed maps and notes of important people. This spy they sent to Bree as their own agent. They crossed the Greyflood at the fords of Tharbad. When they arrived at Sarn Ford on 22 September, the Rangers guarding the ford knew they couldn't defeat the Nazgûl. Some fled to tell Aragorn on the Great East Road, but were pursued and slain or driven away, and those few who remained were soon killed during the night. The Witch-king sent 4 riders into the Shire, with Khamûl going straight to Hobbiton. He made a camp in Andrath and sent several riders to patrol the eastern borders, and himself went to the Barrow-downs for some days and roused the wights and other evil creatures there and in the Old Forest.

## Hunt for Frodo

![](nazgul/12.jpg)

#### A Nazgûl

<53>After searching for Frodo Baggins, one of the Nine, Khamûl the Easterling, had his first encounter with him on the road to Stock. As Frodo and his friends, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took, took Bucklebury Ferry to reach Crickhollow, Khamûl, who had narrowly missed them, was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge instead. Shortly after this, three Nazgûl arrived at Frodo's new home in Crickhollow but found it deserted. Shortly after the Horn-cry of Buckland was sounded and the Ringwraiths retreated.

<53>Though Frodo had already left for Bree by the time the Nine arrived, they were soon given information regarding Frodo's whereabouts by Bill Ferny, a spy of Saruman. Consequently, the Nazgûl attacked the village of Bree, where Frodo was located. However, during the time it took the Nazgûl to reach Bree, Frodo and company, fortunately, encountered Aragorn himself, who had been asked by Gandalf to watch for the hobbits and aid them if he could.

## Weathertop

![](nazgul/7.jpg)

#### Five Nazgûl confronting the four Hobbits at Weathertop

<53>Unable to find the Hobbits, the Nine left Bree; at the hill of Weathertop several days later they encountered Gandalf the Grey, who was scouting nearby on his way to Rivendell to meet up with Frodo. An all-night battle commenced at Weathertop between them and Gandalf. Though Gandalf was able to escape, four of the Nine pursued him, whilst the other five remained near Weathertop.

<53>Several days later, Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry made camp at the base of the hill. Discovering them, the five Nazgûl attacked the group. As they confronted the four Hobbits, Frodo put on the Ring and attempted to resist the Nazgûl. Their leader, the Witch-king of Angmar, realizing the hobbit's folly, stabbed Frodo with a Morgul-knife, but the Nazgûl soon fled when Aragorn arrived, wielding firebrands.

## The Ford of Bruinen

![](nazgul/15.jpg)

#### The Nazgûl in Dol Guldur

> *"Come back! Come back! To Mordor we will take you!"*
>> \- The Fellowship of the Ring

<53>With Frodo wounded, Aragorn and the Hobbits made haste to Rivendell knowing that Ringwraiths were pursuing them. The Elf Glorfindel drove the four pursuing Gandalf off the Last Bridge and then found the Hobbits and Aragorn. Taking Frodo onto his white horse, Asfaloth, they headed to Rivendell at great speed. Regrouping, the Nazgûl chased after him and Frodo until they reached the Ford of Bruinen, where the Nine demanded Frodo give them the Ring. Frodo refused and defied them. Provoked, the Nazgûl crossed the river to take the Ring by force. However, by Elrond's command, the waters of the Bruinen rose, forming a great wave and sweeping the Nine away, killing their horses and rendering them shapeless. This postponed their hunt for the Ring, and they returned on foot to Mordor.

## **War of the Ring**

![](nazgul/9.jpg)

#### Gandalf confronted by the Witch-king

> *"Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shriveled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye."*
>> \- The Witch-king in The Return of the King

<53>Returning to Mordor in complete failure, the Nazgûl were forced to abandon their hunt for the Ring. At this point, the Nine received new mounts to replace their horses: Fellbeasts. One of these was downed by an arrow from Legolas near Sarn Gebir. One Nazgûl circled above Frodo and Sam while they were crossing the Dead Marshes. Nazgûl passed over the wasteland before Mordor three times, making Gollum fear they knew about the ring.

<53>After Peregrin Took looked into the palantír of Orthanc after the Destruction of Isengard, Sauron sent one of the Nazgûl to Orthanc to see what Saruman was doing. This same Nazgûl or possibly another then flew to Edoras, alighting on Meduseld and causing Gandalf to order the muster of Rohan be moved to Dunharrow.

<53>With his new mount, the Witch-king attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath with an army of Orcs and secured it. After this, he launched an assault on Minas Tirith, leading Sauron's forces during the Siege of Gondor and Battle of the Pelennor Fields. During the battle, the Witch-king confronted Gandalf the White when attempting to enter the city. However, before the Witch-king could engage Gandalf in battle, the forces of Rohan arrived, making him leave immediately.

<53>A few hours later the Witch-king attacked King Théoden on the battlefield. As Théoden was crushed by his horse Snowmane, the Lord of the Nazgûl prepared to finish him. However, Éowyn and Meriadoc Brandybuck found them on the field, and she confronted the Witch-king. Éowyn killed his winged mount, and the Witch-king attacked her with his mace. Injuring her arm, he prepared to kill her before Meriadoc stabbed his leg from behind with his Barrow-blade, of Westernesse make. At this the Witch-king screamed in pain and Éowyn stabbed her sword into his crown and body, slaying him and fulfilling the prophecy of Glorfindel.

## Battle of the Morannon and Defeat

![](nazgul/10.jpg)

#### Nazgûl caught in the firestorm and destroyed

<53>During Battle of the Black Gate the remaining eight Nazgûl, mounted on Fellbeasts, attacked the Army of the West. Eventually, however, the Nazgûl were confronted by the Eagles, led by Gwaihir.

<53>Simultaneously, Frodo Baggins claimed the Ring for himself near the fires of Mount Doom. Sauron immediately became aware of him, as well as his own folly. Enraged and frantic, Sauron ordered the Nazgûl to fly with all possible speed to Mount Doom and seize the Ring.

<53>However, the Nazgûl failed; the Ring was cast into the fires of Mount Doom when Gollum bit Frodo's finger and accidentally fell into the Cracks of Doom himself, bearing the ring. Sauron was immediately defeated by the loss of the Ring, Mount Doom erupted and all eight Nazgûl were destroyed. Their mounts were destroyed in the eruption whilst their form and power dissipated forever with the ending of the power of the Rings.

# Weapons and abilities

![](nazgul/11.jpg)

#### The Witch-king

> *"Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!"*
>> \- The Witch-king in The Return of the King

<53>The Nazgûl were sustained by the power of Sauron. The Witch-king in particular was difficult to slay, for any weapon that struck him would be destroyed. The Nazgûl's own weapons included long swords of steel and daggers. Their leader possessed a powerful black mace as well. Their arsenal of deadly armaments was not confined to physical means; they also had powerful voices, which brought terror into the hearts of mortals and a general aura of dread. They wore hauberks of silver mail and had enhanced senses of hearing and smell.

<53>The Nine could not see during the day as mortals; instead they saw shadowy forms. At night they saw shapes and forms invisible to mortal eyes, and were to be feared the most at that time. Their presence could be felt as a troubling of the heart, and they could more keenly feel the presence of others. In their function, they particularly sensed the presence of the Ring at all times, and were drawn to it especially if it was put on.

<53>They were surrounded by an aura of terror, which affected all living creatures; their aura called the Black Breath could be toxic to those hapless enough to come near them. This fear the Nine inspired was one of their greatest strengths. According to Gandalf, if Sauron regained the One, they would become vastly more powerful (in an unspecified way). However, as Sauron's strength grew in the course of The Lord of the Rings, the Nazgûl did become more powerful. In The Fellowship of the Ring, their cries were simply unnerving to the hobbits, and they appeared to be physically weak, as Aragorn managed to fend against five of them single-handedly on Weathertop. In The Return of the King however, their cries are powerful enough to send all but the most stout-hearted of Gondor's defenders into helpless terror, and the Witch-king in particular had become so powerful that he challenged the reborn Gandalf the White. Moreover, some or all of them practiced sorcery, using spells for wicked purposes.

# Weaknesses

---

![](nazgul/13.jpg)

#### A Nazgûl set on fire

<53>Though the Ringwraiths were among the greatest of Sauron's servants, they also had certain weaknesses that could be used against them. One of these was daylight itself. With the exception of the Witch-king of Angmar, none of them (especially Khamûl) could operate as well under the Sun and generally feared it.

<53>All the Ringwraiths but the Witch-king feared water, although it seems this weakness was abandoned by J.R.R. Tolkien in the published version because it was an idea difficult to sustain.

<53>At Weathertop, Aragorn used fire to drive the Ringwraiths away from Frodo. Even the Witch-king feared fire. At the Ford of Bruinen, Aragorn and the hobbits that accompanied Frodo used it to assist Glorfindel and drive the Ringwraiths into the raging water.

<53>If an enemy was strong enough so to resist their aura of dread, then the Ringwraiths (with the exception of the Witch-king) had little real power over them individually.

<53>Heroes of Middle-earth such as Aragorn, Gandalf, and Glorfindel could single-handedly face a Ringwraith and defeat or at least elude them, provided that they were not confronted by multiple Ringwraiths or the Witch-king. However, only a few could resist them all at the same time. Glorfindel was able to in fact instill fear in the Nazgûl's hearts.

# Mounts

![](nazgul/14.jpg)

#### The Witch-king mounted on his Fell-beast

<53>At the start of the War of the Ring, the Nine rode black horses descended from horses stolen from Rohan, which they relied heavily on for transport. However, after the encounter with Glorfindel at the Ford of Bruinen, the Black Riders lost their horses, which were killed in the flood.

<53>Returning to Mordor by foot to regroup, the Nazgûl received winged creatures from Sauron in addition to new horses. With these winged "fell beasts", the nine attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath in order to clear the way for a siege of Minas Tirith. Subsequently, the Nazgûl used the fell beasts to their advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of the Morannon, but most of all in attempting to seek and find the Ring-bearer, Frodo.

# Etymology

---

<53>The term Nazgûl, which literally means "Ring-wraith," comes from the Black Speech words nazg ("ring") and gûl ("wraith").

<53>The rarely used Quenya name for the Nazgûl is Úlairi.
