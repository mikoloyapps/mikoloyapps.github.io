# History

<53>After swearing an Oath to recover the Silmarils at any and all costs, they and their father led the Ñoldor from Valinor to Beleriand in pursuit of Morgoth, who had stolen Fëanor's greatest work, the Silmarils.[1] Since Fëanor died soon after in battle, his sons were one of the key driving forces behind the ensuing wars. Their heroism was great and they were mighty leaders and foes of Morgoth, but because of the Oath of Fëanor (which they all swore), their actions were ultimately turned to evil.

#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>Only one son survived the First Age. Because of the nature of their Oath that they would not permit anyone else to have the Silmarils. This was originally meant to refer to Morgoth, but ultimately encompassed their fellow Elves and even the Valar. Thus, their deaths were generally not in battle with Morgoth but rather in desperate, Oath-driven assaults on other Elves. The only two not killed in such a manner were Maedhros (who killed himself at the very end of the First Age), and Maglor (who survived only to wander sadly alone along the shores of Middle-earth).
