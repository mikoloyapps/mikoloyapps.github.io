#### Eldalote & Angrod

<53>**Eldalótë** was the wife of Angrod, second son of Finarfin, and grandmother of Finduilas and Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in the Second Age.

# History
---

<53>Eldalótë was a Noldorin Elf, likely born in Aman. It was in Eldamar that she married Angrod and had one son named Orodreth. Orodreth later escaped to Nargothrond when his father was slain in the Dagor Bragollach.

<53>She probably went into exile and translated her name to Sindarin in Middle-earth (the Noldor who did not reach it had no Sindarin names). However, she is not mentioned in any of the tales of Beleriand, and so nothing else is known of her fate.

# Etymology

---

<53>Eldalótë was Quenya for 'Elf Flower'. Edhellos (or Eðellos) is the Sindarin translation of her name.
