<53>**Celegorm**, called Celegorm the Fair[3], was the third son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, most closely associated with another brother, Curufin. He is somewhat anomalously described as having fair hair, rather than the black or red hair of his parents and his six siblings.

<53>Celegorm was a great huntsman, and a friend of the Vala Oromë. From Oromë he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a number of their languages. He had brought with him from Valinor the great hound Huan, a gift from Oromë.

# History

<53>Celegorm was born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. He was very close to Oromë and probably hunted with him in his woods.

#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>After the theft of the Silmarils and the death of their grandfather, he and his father and his brothers took an oath to recover them at any cost. Celegorm, bound to his oath, came to Middle-earth with the exiled Ñoldor and established great realms in exile, joining with their relatives in the House of Fingolfin to wage war against the armies of Morgoth. Celegorm and his brother were great lords in the land of Himlad. They were defeated and overwhelmed by the successful sudden assault of Morgoth during the Dagor Bragollach. Celegorm and Curufin lost Himlad and fled south to the marches of Doriath. Not being welcome there due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Celegorm, Curufin, and their people settled in Nargothrond.

<53>While he and his brother lived in Nargothrond, they captured Lúthien Tinúviel, daughter of King Thingol of Doriath. Celegorm wished to marry her, thus forcing a bond of kinship with Thingol. Huan, however, broke with his master and helped Lúthien escape, foiling his scheme. Afterwards, he and his brother were expelled from Nargothrond. Celegorm fell at Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of King Dior of Doriath. Celegorm was slain by Dior in the halls of Menegroth.

# Etymology

---

<53>His father-name was Turcafinwë ("Strong [in body] Finwë). His mother-name was Tyelkormo ("Hasty-riser"), from the Quenya word tyelka ("hasty"), possibly in references to his quick temper and habit of leaping when angered.
