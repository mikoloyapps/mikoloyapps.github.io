#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>Like Rúmil, Orophin knew very little Westron; therefore, he associated little with the Fellowship of the Ring. When Haldir saw Gollum rustling through the trees near where the hobbits stayed for the night, Orophin left his brothers to warn the Galadhrim.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Orophin is either Sindarin or Silvan Elvish. It may mean "small tree", from Sindarin oron ("tree") and pîn ("small"), or "mountain peak", from orod ("mountain") and pind ("peak, crest").
