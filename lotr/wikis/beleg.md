<53>**Beleg**, also known as **Beleg Cúthalion** or **Beleg Strongbow** for his good bowmanship, was a Sindarin Elf who served in the army of King Elu Thingol of Doriath as Chief Marchwarden - and was a predominant companion of Túrin Turambar.

<53>Beleg "followed no man", and "could not be restrained".

#### Beleg Departs Menegroth

<53>When Melkor's Orcs invaded the Forest of Brethil, Halmir, Chieftain of the Haladin, called to Thingol for aid. Thingol sent Beleg with force of Sindar to aid the Haladin, and the two peoples ambushed and destroyed an orc-legion in the deeps of the forest. Afterwards, the Orcs dared not cross the Teiglin for many years, leaving the peoples north of the river in relative peace.

<53>He and his friend Mablung were the only Elves of Doriath to fight with the Union of Maedhros in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the war.

#### Beleg receives Anglachel

<53>He and Mablung were great captains of the Sindar, and Beleg was part of the Hunting of the Great Wolf Carcharoth during the trials of Beren and Lúthien.

<53>Later, he became a good friend and brother-in-arms of Túrin Turambar, a young Man of Dor-lómin. When Túrin left Doriath, Beleg received permission from Thingol to follow him into exile and bring him the king's pardon, wielding the black sword Anglachel that Eöl had forged and given to Thingol in tribute. Beleg found the band of outlaws Túrin was leading while Túrin was away scouting, and was tortured by some of them until Túrin found and released him. Unable to persuade Túrin to return to Doriath with him, Beleg returned to King Thingol and gained permission to join Túrin in his free exploits, taking with him the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin as a gift for Túrin. He went into the wilds again and found Túrin on Amon Rûdh. Together with Túrin, he became for a while a captain against Morgoth, and the land they dwelt in became known as the Land of Bow and Helm or Dor-Cúarthol in Sindarin.

#### Beleg is Slain

<53>When Túrin was captured by the Orcs, Beleg was grievously wounded, yet with the knowledge and strength of an elite Elven warrior he recovered and followed the Orcs. He met the escaped thrall Gwindor in Taur-nu-Fuin, and together they rescued Túrin, but as Beleg cut the bonds from Túrin's wrists and ankles he slipped, accidentally cutting Túrin with his sword. Túrin awoke and did not recognize Beleg in the darkness, assuming the shape bent over him with a blade was an Orc and that he was to be tortured again. In a sudden rage of self-defense, he wrested the sword from Beleg and killed him.

<53>After his death Túrin made the song Laer Cú Beleg, The Song of the Great Bow, and was known to sing it at times of grief and pain, in honor of his fallen friend and comrade.
