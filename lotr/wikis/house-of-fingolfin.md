<53> The **House of Fingolfin** was a royal House of the Ñoldor.

# History
---

<53>The House was founded by Fingolfin son of Finwë during the Years of the Trees. Fingolfin married Anairë and had four children with her: Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon. The family lived in Tirion until the Revolt of the Ñoldor, in which all the members of the House, with the exception of Anairë, followed the House of Fëanor into exile. After the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Fingolfin led his House to cross the Helcaraxë, where Turgon's wife Elenwë perished.

<53>The Kingship of the Ñoldor passed over to Fingolfin after Fingon's rescue of Maedhros from Thangorodrim. Thus, the House held the northwestern lands of Beleriand: Nevrast, Dor-lómin, Hithlum, and Gondolin. During the Dagor Bragollach, Fingolfin fell and Fingon took the Kingship, ruling Hithlum until his death during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. According to The Silmarillion, Turgon later inherited the High Kingship rather than Fingon's son, Gil-galad, likely because Gil-galad was very young whereas Turgon had greater experience. Nevertheless, after Turgon's demise in the fall of Gondolin, his nephew Gil-galad became High King of the Ñoldor. Accounts differ of the exact parentage of Gil-galad.

<53>After the Nírnaeth, Tuor son of Huor arrived in Gondolin and wedded Idril, Turgon's daughter. This was the second union of Elves and Men after that of Beren and Lúthien. After the Fall of Gondolin in FA 510, the exiles lived at the Mouths of Sirion with the surviving Elves of Doriath. Here, Eärendil son of Tuor and Idril wedded Elwing daughter of Dior. They had two sons, Elros and Elrond, called the Half-elven, who were given the choice to be counted among either the Elves or Men. Elrond chose to be of the Firstborn while Elros chose to be counted among the Men and became the first King of Númenor.
