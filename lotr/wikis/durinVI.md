<53>**Durin VI** was the sixth Dwarven king to bear the name of Durin. In his lifetime he ruled Durin's Folk from the city of Khazad-dûm.

# History
---

<53>As with all descendants of Durin I bearing that name, he was considered by many to be the reincarnation of the first dwarf because of the great similarity in appearance and manner. At least following the death of his father, he bore the ring of power carried by his ancestors since Durin III.

<53>In the final year of his reign, the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm discovered a sleeping Balrog while mining for mithril. The Balrog was wakened, and thereafter laid waste to Khazad-dûm, killing both Durin VI and his son Náin I. Khazad-dûm would remain lost to the Dwarves for over a thousand years while the Balrog remained.
