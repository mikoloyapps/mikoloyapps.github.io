<53>The **Galadhrim** (S.: "People of the Trees") were the Elven people of mixed Nandorin, Avarin, and Sindarin descent, who lived in the forest of Lothlórien that was ruled by Kings Amdír and Amroth originally and Galadriel and Celeborn later.

# History
---

<53>The Galadhrim were mostly Silvan Elves, descendants of the Nandor who had not continued the journey westward. In the Second Age they took the Sindarin Elf Amdír as their king and he ruled until he was slain with many of his people during the Battle of Dagorlad.

#### Galadhrim Elves (Haldir is shown in the foreground)

<53>In TA 1980, a Balrog in Khazad-dûm was freed. Upon this event, many Galadhrim fled south to Edhellond with their king, Amroth. The Galadhrim that remained lived quietly in Lórien, protected from the menaces of Dol Guldur and the Orcs of the Misty Mountains by the power of Galadriel until the end of the Third Age. With the departure of Galadriel to the Undying Lands, Lórien quickly became deserted. The remaining Galadhrim either went with Celeborn to Rivendell or presumably joined with Thranduil's people in the Greenwood.

<53>Their language was a dialect of Sindarin.Galadhrim was also the name used for the realm's warriors.
