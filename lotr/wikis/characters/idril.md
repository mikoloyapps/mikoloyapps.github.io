<53>**Idril**, also called Celebrindal, was a Ñoldorin Elf of Gondolin. She was the daughter of Turgon and Elenwë, wife of the Man Tuor, and mother of Eärendil the Mariner, a Half-elven.

# History
---

<53>Idril Celebrindal was the only child of Turgon, whose wife Elenwë perished during the crossing of the Helcaraxë. Together with Angrod's son Orodreth, she was one of the two Ñoldor in the third generation to come into exile. Idril was loved in secret by her cousin Maeglin, the son of Eöl the Dark Elf and Aredhel, Turgon's sister, but she scorned his advances because of his dark character, as well as the fact that they were too closely related.

<53>When Tuor, son of Huor, arrived in Gondolin, Idril fell in love with him. Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second union of Men and Elves, after Beren and Lúthien. Their son Eärendil was born shortly afterwards.

<53>Being far-sighted she sensed danger and she encouraged Tuor to prepare a secret passage under the city so that if the city was attacked survivors could safely escape. After the Fall of Gondolin, Idril and Tuor became leaders of the exiles at the Mouths of Sirion in West Beleriand in the region of Arvernien, where they also received Elwing, daughter of Dior.

<53>When Tuor grew old, he and Idril departed in his ship for the West. It is believed by the Elves and the Dúnedain that Idril and Tuor safely arrived in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar. Moreover, it was thought that Tuor was reckoned in the kindred of the Elves, and that both Idril and her husband thereafter dwelt in Valinor.

<53>The union of Tuor and Idril was the second between a mortal Man and an Elven maid. Her son Eärendil married Elwing, daughter of Dior the grand-daughter of Beren and Lúthien, so Idril became the grandmother of Elrond and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of Númenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of the Kingdom of Númenor, and then through the Lords of Andúnië to the House of Elendil, living in exile in Middle-earth, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Idril is the Sindarin form of her Quenya name Itarillë (or Itarildë), which means "sparkling brilliance". Celebrindal is also a Sindarin word attached to her name which means "silver-foot", due to the fact that she always walked in her barefeet.
