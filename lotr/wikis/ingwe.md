# History
---

<53>Ingwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to Ilion, who was the direct descendant of Imin and Iminyë. After Oromë discovered the Quendi, Ingwë was part of the first embassy to Aman alongside his friends Finwë and Elwë, and became the lord of the first Kindred of the Elves, the later Vanyar, who led his people in the Great Journey. His name means "first one / chief" in Quenya.

#### Ingwe, Elwe and Finwe meeting the Valar

<53>First of the Vanyar to travel to Valinor with Oromë, Ingwë loved its beauty and bliss and, returning to his people, urged them to undertake a journey to Aman. He and his kin took the journey, were fascinated with the Valar, and decided not to return to Middle-earth. They stayed and made Ingwë their king. The Mindon Eldaliéva, in Tirion, was built in honor of him.

<53>Ingwë was reckoned as High King of all the Eldalië, the Elves of the Great Journey, and because of this he was called Ingwë Ingweron; the "Chief of the Chieftains". He lived in Taniquetil, ruling from beneath Manwë High King of Arda.

<53>Ingwë never set foot on Middle-earth after he began living in Taniquetil. When the Vanyar took up arms in the War of Wrath and followed the Host of Valinor, Ingwë did not join them, but his son Ingwion led the Vanyarin warriors, capturing Eglarest in the first battle of the war.
