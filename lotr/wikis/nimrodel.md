<53>**Nimrodel** was a Nandorin Elf-maiden of Lórien in the Third Age.

# History
---

<53>Nimrodel had lived in Lothlórien before the Sindar and Ñoldor were seen in the forest. She was unhappy with these newcomers, thinking they would bring the turmoils of Middle-earth to the golden forest. She lived separately near the river that would later bear her name, and spoke only her native tongue. The only good thing she saw in Lórien was the Sinda Amroth, King of the Wood. They both found love for each other, but she refused to marry him.

<53>After a Balrog awoke in nearby Khazad-dûm in TA 1980, Nimrodel grew more uneasy in Lórien. She fled, and made her way to the edge of Fangorn Forest, but could not enter it. Amroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they travelled to Edhellond, the port city in Belfalas, and thence set sail to the Undying Lands. They were accompanied by a small staff of Silvan Elves, including Mithrellas. All went well until they reached the White Mountains in TA 1981. The group became separated, and Amroth reached Edhellond well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship. When a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore. But he was quickly taken by Belegaer's strong currents and drowned.

<53>Nimrodel, in the meantime, had settled for a while at the river Gilrain, which reminded her of home. She sat by the starlit stream and slept for a long while. After waking she journeyed further, but found no ship in Edhellond, and Amroth was long dead at the bottom of the sea.

<53>After she found no ship in Edhellond and found out that her lover Amroth drowned in the sea. What she did after leaving the haven was unknown. She might have died later due to a broken heart.
