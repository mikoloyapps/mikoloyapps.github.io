# History

## **Origins**

<53>During the Great Journey of the Elves of Cuiviénen, the Teleri had two lords: Elwë Singollo and his brother Olwë. While crossing Beleriand, however, Elwë became lost in the forests, wherefore many of the Teleri refused to continue into westward.

#### The Ships of the Teleri Drawn by Swans

<53>When Ulmo came to them with an island, the Teleri had come to love the sea. The island was brought towards the Bay of Eldamar. They settled on Tol Eressëa (the former island ferry) and later in Alqualondë, which they built on the shores of Aman between the Calacirya and Araman.

<53>The High King of the Falmari was Olwë, and the Princess of the Falmari was Eärwen, Olwë's daughter.

## **Rebellion of the Ñoldor**

<53>During rebellion of the Ñoldor led by Fëanor, the Sea-elves refused to join the rebellion and to yield their swanships. This led to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Falmari means "Wave-folk", from the Quenya terms fala ("foam") and falma ("wave as it breaks").
