<53>As a descendant of Durin I who bore the same name, Durin III was considered by many Dwarves to be the reincarnation of the original Durin due to the great similarity in appearance and manner.

#### Durin III in The Fellowship of the Ring

<53>Sometime shortly after SA 1500, Durin received one of the Seven rings; the Dwarves of Durin's Folk claimed the ring was given by Celebrimbor himself, and not by Sauron, though Sauron was involved in the making. This was the ring that Thráin II later carried and had taken from him when he was captured by the agents of Sauron. During the War of the Elves and Sauron the Dark Lord's forces were on the point of overtaking and destroying the refugees and army of Elrond, when the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm sortied from the Doors of Durin and attacked Sauron's forces in the rear, giving the Elves time to escape and earning the Dark Lord's enmity. After this time the gates of Khazad-dûm were shut.
