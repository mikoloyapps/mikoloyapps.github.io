<53>**Thráin II** was the father of Thorin II Oakenshield, and the son of King Thrór, making him a direct descendant of Durin the Deathless. After his father Thrór was beheaded by Azog in Moria, Thráin became the rightful King under the Mountain as well as the King of Durin's Folk.

# History
---

## **Early life**

<53>Thráin was born in the Lonely Mountain to Thrór, who was King under the Mountain. He married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Thorin, Frerin, and Dís.

## **Life in exile**

<53>Thráin fled Erebor with his father, his three children, and the surviving Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain when the dragon Smaug descended on the mountain in TA 2770, desolating the kingdom and claiming its treasure. Exiled, he and his relatives wandered farther south, and they eventually settled in the hills of Dunland. They would remain in Dunland for twenty years, reduced to poverty.

<53>Years after the destruction of Erebor, poverty took a toll on the mind of King Thrór, rendering him restless and desperate. He sought to journey away searching for a scrap of wealth, though he did not specify Moria. At their parting, he gave to his son Thráin his Ring of power and the Map and Key to the Side-door of the Lonely Mountain. He departed from his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named Nár.

## **War of the Dwarves and Orcs**

<53>Nár would return to their dwelling in Dunland many weeks later, but he would return alone. He told the tale to Thráin of what had become of his father Thrór, who had brashly ventured into Moria, despite the pleas of Nár not to go in, but he did not return. Days later, it was revealed that the King had been branded and murdered by Azog the Orc who claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Durin's Folk.

<53>When Thráin heard Nár's recounting of what had become of his father and that an Orc was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard and then fell silent. For seven days, he sat and said no word. However, on the seventh day, he stood up and declared, "This cannot be borne!" These words were the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.

<53>Thráin sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the world. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Dwarven Fathers. The kings of the other Houses answered to Thráin's call to vengeance, as they all saw this heinous deed committed by Azog to be a profound dishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their fury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar took place beneath the East-gate of Moria in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were inflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Thorin Oakenshield, was among those that fell. Thráin himself had been wounded in the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of war, at last, turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late. Realizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the Dwarves, Azog turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was slain by Dáin Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war.

## **Later life and capture**

<53>Afterward, Thráin led the remainder of his people - among them his eldest son Thorin Oakenshield - back to Dunland, where they dwelt for a while. Eventually, they relocated to the northern Blue Mountains, where they made their dwelling. After some time, they showed signs of prosperity, and their numbers slowly began to increase.

<53>Many years later, Thráin grew older, and he became restless, fed by the Ring of Power in his possession. His desire to reclaim his kingdom of the Lonely Mountain grew. In TA 2841, he and a group of followers, including Balin and Dwalin, left their dwelling in the Blue Mountains and journeyed into Wilderland. The servants of Sauron pursued them, and one morning in TA 2845, in the eaves of Mirkwood, his companions awoke to find that Thráin was missing. They searched in vain for him for days, but he could not be found at all. It was later learned that he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Sauron's stronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood. There he was tortured, and Sauron took from him the last of the Dwarven Rings of Power and left him there to die.

<53>Before Thráin's death - while on a mission to Dol Guldur - Gandalf the Grey came upon Thráin and was given the map and key made by his father, Thrór. Thráin appeared so diminished that he had forgotten almost everything, including his name. Gandalf promised to deliver it to Thorin but could not confirm that this Dwarf was, in fact, Thráin due to Thráin's loss of memory. There he died.

## **Legacy**

<53>Years later, Gandalf met with Thorin near the village of Bree. There Gandalf promised to help Thorin on his quest to reclaim Erebor. The most notable way Gandalf helped was when he invited the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins on the journey to act as the company's burglar.

<53>Several decades later, during the Council of Elrond, Glóin revealed that part of Balin's motivation for attempting to re-enter Moria was to find the last Dwarven Ring of Power, which was last seen in Thrór's possession. Gandalf regretfully informed them that Thrór had passed the ring to Thráin, and when Thráin was captured in Dol Guldur, the ring was stripped from his possession. Glóin mourned this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the Dwarves would have their vengeance against the Dark Lord Sauron.
