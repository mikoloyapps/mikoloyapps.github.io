# History
---

## **First and Second Ages**

<53>Oropher was one of the Sindar of Doriath. After the War of Wrath, he declined to depart Middle-earth as many others did, and instead went over the Blue Mountains with his household. He eventually ended up in Greenwood the Great, where Silvan Elves of Nandorin descent lived, and he was taken by them as lord. His capital was at Amon Lanc.

<53>West of Oropher's realm was the realm of Lórinand across the Anduin, where Amdír, another Sindar, ruled over Silvan Elves.

## War of Last Alliance

<53>Before the War of the Last Alliance, Oropher and his folk left their capital at Amon Lanc and crossed Anduin to live with their kin in Lórinand. Three times, he moved his people northwards, eventually settling around Emyn Duir, the Mountains of Mirkwood. His retreat northwards was because of his desire to move "out of range" from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and avoid the threat of Mordor.

<53>Though he and his people had little to do with other peoples of Middle-earth, Oropher understood that there could be no lasting peace until Sauron was defeated. Oropher answered the summons for the Last Alliance of Elves and Men but marched as an independent force with Amdír, King of Lórien. He joined with Gil-galad's forces as they marched down the Anduin to Dagorlad. Oropher's force was lightly armed and untrained in fighting pitched battles in the open.

<53>In the Battle of Dagorlad, Oropher's company fought valiantly, but he was slain with the greater part of his people when he, with King Amdír and his warriors, called an early charge upon the enemy without orders from the Ñoldorin High-king Gil-galad. After Sauron was defeated, Thranduil, Oropher's son and heir, returned to Eryn Galen with the shattered remnants of his people's grand army. Nevertheless, while depleted, his army was still large enough that the Orcs hiding in secret in the Misty Mountains did not dare attack them.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Oropher probably means "Tall beech-tree" from oro ("up, rise, high"). In Doriath, the term orn refers to trees, especially beeches. The terms pher or pheren both mean "beech-tree".
