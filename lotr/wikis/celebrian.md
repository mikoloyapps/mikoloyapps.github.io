<53>**Celebrían** was an Elven noblewoman, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel, wife of Elrond, and the mother of Elladan, Elrohir and Arwen.

# History
---

<53>Celebrían was born early in the Second Age, likely in SA 300, after her mother refused to return to Tol Eressëa, and passed over the Mountains. She lived with her mother Galadriel in Eregion, and later fled to Lórinand sometime between SA 1350 and SA 1400. After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through Khazad-dûm and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond, who, though he loved her, said nothing about it.

<53>In TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and Elrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.

#### Celebrían and Arwen

<53>In TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien when she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains. She was then tormented by the Orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her sons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond healed her wounds, but Celebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and haunted by the memories of her torture, she no longer desired to remain in Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year. Elladan and Elrohir never forgot or forgave their mother's torment, and frequently rode with Aragorn and the Rangers of the North, striking back at the Orcs and other servants of Sauron whenever possible.

# Etymology

<53>The name Celebrían means "Silver queen", from the Sindarin words celeb ("silver") and rían ("queen").
