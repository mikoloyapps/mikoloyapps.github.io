<53>The **House of Thingol** was a noble house of Sindar Elves. The House of Thingol ruled over the realm of Doriath for nearly four millennia, from YT 1152 until FA 506 and the Second Kinslaying.

# History
---

<53>Thingol, originally called Elwë, traveled with his brother Olwë across Middle-earth but in YT 1130 went astray from his people and was lost in Nan Elmoth. In this forest he met Melian, a Maia of Varda, and was entranced by her. He fell into a deep trance and could not be found by Olwë and the Teleri. Some thousand years later, Elwë awoke from his trance and lived with Melian in Beleriand. He established the realm of Doriath and ruled over the Sindarin Elves as Elu Thingol.

<53>In YT 1200, Thingol's daughter Lúthien was born in Neldoreth. After the Quest for the Silmaril in FA 466, Lúthien lived with her lover Beren of the House of Bëor. Thus was the first union between Elves and Men. They had one son Dior, who was called Heir of Thingol, and later King of Doriath. Through Dior and his wife Nimloth, Eluréd, Elurín, and Elwing were members of the House of Thingol. Through Elwing, her sons Elros and Elrond were also members. Through them the line continued and was reunited with the marriage of Aragorn II Elessar and Arwen.
