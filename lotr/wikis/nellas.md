# History
---

<53>Being a lady of nature, she lived in the woods and never came to the city but she knew much and was very wise. Nellas was young during the latter-half of the fourth century First Age and it was during that time that Túrin had come to Doriath as a boy. With the blessings of Melian, she befriended him and became his teacher and he learned much about the wilderness and nature. She also taught him an older and richer form of Sindarin and the many manners of its pronunciation. As he began to grow into manhood, he drifted away from her but she still continued to watch over him be it in secrecy.

<53>Sitting in a tree watching over him, she witnessed the incident between Túrin and Saeros and saw that Saeros had indeed provoked Túrin and was the cause of his own peril. Summoned to appear before the King in one of the few times she walked in the city, she told him about what happen in the woods with great difficulty. After the King pronounced his judgment, she wept over Túrin’s departure and sought to find him but presumably she never saw him again. Her fate is unknown in the latter days of the First Age.

# Etymology

---

<53>Although there appears to be no clear origin of the name Nellas, it is likely to have been Sindarin and may have come from the Sindarin words nellad, nella or nelladel, which all mean "the sound of bells" (or "to sound the bells"), or perhaps the word nell, meaning "bell".

<53>The element nel- may also connect with Elvish words for the number "three", and the final -las could mean "leaf" (as in the name Legolas, Greenleaf), though it is not apparent why a child should be called by a name meaning something like "three leaves".
