#### Descendants of Finwë

<53> The **House of Finwë** was the founding royal house of the Ñoldor in Arda.

# History
---

<53>The House of Finwë was founded soon after the Ñoldor where established in Aman and Finwë married Míriel and then Indis. Their sons Fëanor, Fingolfin, and Finarfin, who founded their own houses, became the successors to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor in both Aman and Middle-earth throughout the ages. Since Elros was of the House of Finwë, it is plausible that all the Kings of the Numenor, Gondor, and Arnor are of the line of Finwë, making them members of the House of Finwë.

<53>The Kingship of the Ñoldor passed over to Fingolfin after Fingon's rescue of Maedhros from Thangorodrim. Thus, the House held the northwestern lands of Beleriand: Nevrast, Dor-lómin, Hithlum, and Gondolin. During the Dagor Bragollach, Fingolfin fell and Fingon took the Kingship, ruling Hithlum until his death during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. According to The Silmarillion, Turgon later inherited the High Kingship rather than Fingon's son, Gil-galad, likely because Gil-galad was very young whereas Turgon had greater experience. Nevertheless, after Turgon's demise in the fall of Gondolin, his nephew Gil-galad became High King of the Ñoldor. Accounts differ of the exact parentage of Gil-galad.

<53>After the Nírnaeth, Tuor son of Huor arrived in Gondolin and wedded Idril, Turgon's daughter. This was the second union of Elves and Men after that of Beren and Lúthien. After the Fall of Gondolin in FA 510, the exiles lived at the Mouths of Sirion with the surviving Elves of Doriath. Here, Eärendil son of Tuor and Idril wedded Elwing daughter of Dior. They had two sons, Elros and Elrond, called the Half-elven, who were given the choice to be counted among either the Elves or Men. Elrond chose to be of the Firstborn while Elros chose to be counted among the Men and became the first King of Númenor.
