#### Éowyn and the Nazgul

<53>The fellbeasts were described as large, winged creatures without feathers, that had pinions in between their horned fingers, and whose bodies gave off a stench. It is possible that fellbeasts came from "an older world". The dark lord Sauron bred these fellbeasts and gave them to the Nine as mounts.

#### A Nazgûl on his Fellbeast in The Two Towers film

<53>When seeking and pursuing Frodo, the Nine Nazgûl rode coal-black horses. These steeds were consumed at the Ford of Bruinen by the flood caused by Elrond's intercession, and the Nine also vanished in the river. Unseen, they eventually returned to Mordor in the next months, and were there given "fellbeasts".

<53>When the Fellowship of the Ring had left Lothlórien and were camped on the western shore of the Anduin, they saw "a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night." When Legolas raised the great bow of Lórien and shot it with an arrow, it gave "a harsh croaking scream" and vanished into the gloom of the Eastern shore.

<53>Frodo, Sam, and Gollum encountered a fellbeast while passing through the Dead Marshes, and in their fright Gollum spoke of "wraiths on wings".

#### Hell-hawks in Middle-earth: Shadow of War

<53>According to the chieftain of Harrowdale, a fellbeast flew over Edoras and stooped just over Meduseld. They described it as being a darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird. After this, Gandalf told the Rohirrim to assemble at Dunharrow rather than outside Edoras to prevent attack.

<53>When Faramir, captain of Gondor, was fleeing from the besieged city of Osgiliath on his way to Minas Tirith, he and his men were many times beset by winged Nazgûl until Gandalf rode out and drove them away with a shaft of white light from his raised hand.

<53>At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Witch-king of Angmar arrived in battle mounted on a fellbeast. When he mortally wounded King Théoden on the field, Éowyn removed her guise as Dernhelm and slew the fellbeast. She then confronted and slew the Nazgûl, with the aid of Meriadoc Brandybuck. The winged Wraiths would later join the Battle of the Black Gate and be engaged by Gwaihir and his Great Eagles, only to flee at the command of Sauron once he sensed Frodo donning the One Ring within Mount Doom. The fellbeasts were then destroyed in the ensuing eruption.

# Interpretations

#### A Nazgûl on his fellbeast in BFME II

<53>There is a common misconception that these creatures are called Nazgûl, probably due to the fact that the unit in many video games (combined Fellbeast and Ringwraith) was called a Nazgûl. Another possible explanation is the line in The Return of the King where the Witch-king says "Do not come between the Nazgûl and his prey" referring to himself, but shortly before, his mount had appeared to try to eat Théoden's horse.

<53>olkien did not use fellbeast as a proper name, merely describing the beasts as "fell." Fell, a Middle English adjective (from the Old French fel "cruel, dreadful") has come to mean, in Modern English, "ferocious, fierce, terrible, cruel, dreadful", and implies an underlying malevolence or hostility that make the noun described all the worse for the ill-will that drives its suddenness and intensity. Given the rarity of fell (which had all but disappeared from Modern English until Tolkien's work revived it), the beasts having no other name, Tolkien's fans have often, if not quite correctly, dubbed them "fellbeasts." (c.f., e.g., "fell light in his eyes" and "fell meats.")

<53>While occasionally interpreted as resembling pterosaurs, Tolkien himself stated that the creatures were not intended to be "pterodactylic", though he conceded similarities. For the most part, while fellbeasts vaguely resemble outdated pterosaur depictions, they are vastly different from the modern scientific interpretation of these animals, as endothermic, hairy quadrupedes instead of "featherless birds".
