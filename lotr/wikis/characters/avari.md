<53>The **Avari** were a branch of the Elven race in Middle-earth, the group of Moriquendi ('Elves of Darkness') who never journeyed to Aman, and their descendants. They were also known as **Avamanyar** (Quenya for 'Those who would not go to Aman'), as opposed to the Amanyar, 'Those of Aman', and Úmanyar, 'Not of Aman'.

# History
---

<53>When Oromë found that Elves had awakened in Cuiviénen, he invited them to come with him to Valinor. All the Minyar and most of the Tatyar and Nelyar were persuaded and followed Oromë into the west on the Great Journey. The remainder of the Tatyar and Nelyar remained suspicious of the Lords of the west, seeing them only in their wrath, or they simply refused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout the wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after known in Quenya, the language of the Eldar that eventually reached Valinor, by the name Avari, meaning "the Unwilling", because they refused the summons.

#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>Having never come to Valinor, the Avari remained wild folk, dwellers of forests. Little is known of them, as they do not appear in any of the tales, save some references to Avari creeping in the south of Beleriand in the First Age. Some of them merged with the Nandor and Sindar in Eriador and the Vale of Anduin. Also, it is speculated that the Avari were the first other sentient race encountered by the race of Men during their infancy and they probably taught them many of the basic crafts of civilization. Though the craft of the Eldar surpassed that of the Avari even more than that of the Avari surpassed primitive Men.

<53>In The War of the Jewels, names of six tribes of Avari in their own languages are given, all being cognates of the Quenya term Quendi (the Speakers): Kindi, Cuind, Hwenti, Windan, Kinn-lai, Penni. They are the only certain Avarin words ever mentioned in the published Middle-earth material. It is speculated however that Dorwinion was an Avarin land, with Winion carrying the meaning "wine".

<53>The Silmarillion suggests that Orcs might have been descended from Avarin Elves captured and corrupted by Melkor.

<53>Eöl was called the 'Dark Elf' for how he shunned the daylight, preferring to stay within the dark woods of Nan Elmoth and walk at nighttime, but he was not of Avari descent, being related to Thingol.
