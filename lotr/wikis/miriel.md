#### Finwë and Míriel

<53>**Míriel Therindë** or **Míriel Serindë** was the first wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the mother of Fëanor. Miriel's hair was described as being silver in appearance, an unusual color for one of the Ñoldor. She was highly skilled in the art of weaving and needlework, and thus her amilessë (mother-name) was Þerindë, the Broideress.

# History
---

<53>Míriel married Finwë sometime during the Noontide of Valinor and they lived in Tirion. In YT 1169, Míriel bore a son, called Curufinwë, whom she called Fëanáro ("Spirit of Fire"). After giving birth to him she could no longer live, and so wished to die, something which was impossible because, as an Elf, she was immortal within Arda.

#### Finwë near his wife Míriel Serindë

<53>In YT 1170, she laid down in his gardens where her fëa peacefully departed from her body, and she entered the Halls of Mandos: in essence freely losing her will to live. Her body was tended by the maidens of Estë and remained preserved. Her death was seen as a shocking event by the Valar; it eventually led to the second marriage of Finwë, and from there to the Rebellion of the Ñoldor and the First Kinslaying.

<53>After Finwë had been killed, Míriel was granted permission to return to life, where she entered the service of Vairë, her task to weave all the deeds of the House of Finwë in the Tapestry of Time.

# Etymology

---

<53>Míriel means "Jewel-woman" or perhaps "Jewel-daughter", and her amilessë Þerindë "Broideress". Serindë is a later version of her name after changes in the language of the Noldor. However, she requested that her kin continue to call her Þerindë (Þ is pronounced "th" so therindë ).
