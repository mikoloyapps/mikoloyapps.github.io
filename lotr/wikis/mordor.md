![](mordor/1.jpg)

<53>**Mordor** was a black, volcanic plain in the southeast of Middle-earth to the east of Gondor, Ithilien, and the great river Anduin. Mordor was chosen by Sauron as his realm because of the mountain ranges surrounding it on three sides, creating a natural fortress against his enemies.

# Geography

---

<53>Mordor was protected from three sides by large mountain ranges, arranged roughly in a rectangular manner: the Ash Mountains ('Ered Lithui') in the north, and Ephel Dúath ('Mountains of Shadow') in the west and south. In the northwest corner of Mordor the deep valley of Udûn was one of the few entrances for large armies. Guarding the entrance was the Black Gate of Mordor. In front of the Black Gate lay the Dagorlad or the Battle Plain. Sauron's main fortress of Barad-dûr sat at the end of a spur of the Ered Lithui. To the southwest of Barad-dûr lay the arid plateau of Gorgoroth and Mount Doom; to the east lay the plain of Lithlad. Mordor's geography was excellent for defense against enemies attacking on all fronts, for nearly un-scalable mountains defended Mordor on three sides, while the broken, jagged land of Gorgoroth and Núrn would greatly impede any army that managed to break through.

![](mordor/2.jpg)

<53>Mordor's dry and blasted geography would also be extremely unfriendly to any army bivouacked on the plains, forcing a withdrawal within days (unless they have stores sufficient for months). The only other paths for armies to cross into Mordor from the west, over the Ephel Dúath were the Morgul Pass and the Pass of Cirith Ungol. Isildur originally built the city of Minas Ithil to guard the western end of both passes from any threat from Mordor, but in the Third Age the population of the city waned and it was conquered by the Nazgûl. It became the home of the Ringwraiths and was renamed Minas Morgul, and was thereafter a great stronghold of evil, ever at war with Gondor to the west until the end of the War of the Ring. To escape the vigilance of Morgul, to enter Mordor one would still have to get past the lair of Shelob, and the Tower of Cirith Ungol- a feat only Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee (led by Gollum) ever accomplished- though not without being waylaid by the great fearsome spider Shelob, and Frodo being taken prisoner to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

<53>The southern part of Mordor called Núrn was slightly more fertile, and watered enough to hold the inland Sea of Núrnen. Nurn was made somewhat fertile because the ash blown from Mount Doom left its soil nutrient-rich, thus allowing dry-land farming.

<53>To the west of Mordor was the narrow land of Ithilien with the city of Osgiliath and the great river Anduin, while directly east of it was Rhûn, and to the southeast, Khand.

<53>The east of Mordor is by far the least mentioned of any of Mordor's geographic notes and descriptions. One might assume that the easiest route to Mount Doom would be for the Fellowship to journey through the 'unguarded' section in the east, which no mountains obstructed. However, it would have been difficult to pass unnoticed, because the many roads running from Mordor into Rhûn were often marched along by Easterlings entering Mordor or patrolling the roads and borders.

# Formation

![](mordor/4.jpg)

#### Mount Doom and the Dark Tower

<53>In The Atlas of Middle-earth, Karen Wynn Fonstad assumes that the lands of Mordor and Khand lay where the inland Sea of Helcar had been, and that the Sea of Rhûn and Sea of Núrnen were its remnants. In particular, she suggested that the uplift of the Plateau of Gorgoroth was closely related to the formation of Mount Doom and that the Ephel Dúath formed as a result of a tectonic uplift caused by the cataclysms of the War of Wrath. However, in The Peoples of Middle-earth, the 12th volume of The History of Middle-earth, that was published after the Atlas, is stated that at least Mount Doom was created by Morgoth during the First Age, so before the draining of the Sea of Helcar. Also the name Mordor was given already before Sauron settled there.

#### Sauron looking over the Orc Army of Gorgoroth

<53>At the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron had gathered great armies to serve him. These included enslaved Men of the East and the South, who spoke a variety of tongues, and Orcs and Trolls, who usually spoke a debased form of the Common Speech. But within Barad-dûr and among the captains of Mordor (the Ringwraiths and other high-ranking servants such as the Mouth of Sauron), the Black Speech was still used, the language devised by Sauron during the Dark Years of the Second Age. In addition to ordinary Orcs and Trolls, Sauron had bred a stronger strain of Orcs, the Black Uruks, and very large Trolls known as Olog-hai who could endure the sun. The Olog-hai knew only the Black Speech.

# History

## **Early history**

![](mordor/6.jpg)

#### The battle of the Siege of Barad-dûr

<53>The Mount Doom was created by Morgoth during the First Age. In unknown moment of First Age, perhaps shortly around the War of Wrath, Shelob left the Nan Dungortheb and settled there with her offspring. Sauron settled in Mordor 1,000 years after the end of the First Age, and it remained the centre of his power for the whole of the Second Age and again at the end of the Third Age of Middle-earth. In the north-western corner of this land stood Mount Doom, where Sauron had forged the One Ring. Near Mount Doom stood Sauron's stronghold Barad-dûr. After this time, Sauron was known as the Dark Lord of Mordor. 

<53>For two and a half thousand years, Sauron ruled Mordor uninterruptedly. Having wrought the Ring, it was from there that he launched the attack upon the Elves of Eregion in the War of the Elves and Sauron. He was repelled by the Men of Númenor. He later opposed Númenor, but such was their power that his own servants deserted him and he was captured by the Númenóreans and brought to their island kingdom, eventually causing its destruction (see the Downfall of Númenor). Immediately after Númenor's destruction, Sauron returned to Mordor as a spirit and resumed his rule.

## **The Last Alliance and Third Age**

![](mordor/7.jpg)

#### Sauron's vast army crossing over Gorgoroth

<53>Sauron's rule was interrupted again when his efforts to destroy Gondor failed; his forces were driven back and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men formed to oppose him. After the Battle of Dagorlad the army of the Last Alliance entered Mordor and besieged the Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually Sauron came forth and was defeated in a final battle on the slopes of Mount Doom. For about 1600 years, Mordor was guarded by Gondor in order to prevent evil from returning. The Towers of the Teeth, Durthang and the Tower of Cirith Ungol were built by Gondor to watch the major entry points to the dark land. Gorgoroth during this time was desolate, with the Barad-dûr levelled down to its foundations.

<53>However following the Great Plague in TA 1636 the watch on Mordor failed and evil began to creep back in. Sauron eventually used the Wainriders to distract and weaken Gondor, and the Nazgûl re-entered in TA 1980. They reclaimed Mordor and started to rebuild its might. Minas Ithil was conquered by the Nine Ringwraiths in TA 2002 and Gondor's abandoned fortresses were occupied by evil creatures. By the time Sauron returned to Mordor in TA 2942 after his false defeat at Dol Guldur (in the events that took place at the time of Bilbo Baggins's quest), Mordor was too strong to be captured by any military might that was available in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. Sauron declared himself openly in TA 2951 and Mount Doom burst into flame three years later.

## **War of the Ring**

![](mordor/8.jpg)

#### Mordor, the Land of Shadow

<53>During the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered all his forces to Mordor. In the north were the great garrisons and forges of war, while surrounding the bitter inland Sea of Núrnen to the south lay the vast fields of Núrn tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of slaves brought in from lands to the east and south. After the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Army of the West marched to the Black Gate. Sauron sent his army to destroy the Men of Gondor and Rohan at the Battle of the Black Gate, but then Frodo Baggins destroyed the One Ring and Mordor fell. Sauron's power was destroyed, sending shock waves through the air and ground. The Dark Tower of Barad-dûr, the Black Gate and the Towers of Teeth collapsed into ruin. Mount Doom erupted and both Sauron and his Ringwraiths were destroyed. The shadows dissipated and Aragorn II Elessar led a campaign to destroy the remaining Orc holds within Mordor.

# Etymology

---

![](mordor/9.jpg)

#### Oliphaunts used in battle during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. These powerful beasts where used in great effect against the Armies of Rohan

<53>Mordor has two meanings: The Black Land or The Dark Land in Tolkien's contrived language Sindarin, and The Land of Shadow in Quenya. The root mor ("dark", "black") also appears in Moria. Dor ("land") also appears in Gondor ("stone-land") and Doriath ("fenced land"). The Quenya word for Shadow is "mordo". It is pronounced with a Russian-sounding r. The gate of Mordor, Morannon, means Black Gate. It was named this by the Elves in the Second Age.

<53>A proposed etymology out of the context of Middle-earth is Old English morthor, which means "mortal sin" or "murder". (The latter are descended from the former.) It is not uncommon for names in Tolkien's fiction to have relevant meanings in several languages, both those invented by Tolkien, and "real" ones, but this of course happens with any two languages. Mordor is also a name cited in some Nordic mythologies referring to a land where its citizens practice evil without knowing it, imposed on themselves by the society long created for that purpose. This quite fits with Tolkien's Mordor.

# Armies

---

<53>Mordor had vast armies at its disposal, all filled with a fierce hatred of the Men of the West. While the Orcs in the land may not have been the most powerful warriors, they were very fierce and could be quite overwhelming in numbers. Other units, like Trolls and allies like the Haradrim, were also gathered into Mordor prior to the launch of the Dark lord's final war.

## **Basic units**

<53>The backbone and most numbered part of Sauron's army were the Orcs. They often used poisoned or fiery arrows to attack their opponents. Though neither the soldiers themselves nor their weapons reached the quality of the "Free Peoples", they were still quite deadly and could swarm over their enemies thanks to their large numbers. They also did not "fight fair" and used whatever strategy (or no strategy) to win.

## **Allies**

<53>Mordor had powerful allies to aid in Sauron's quest for domination. The Easterlings were a more advanced race (than the Orcs) who used deadly swords and pikes. They had finer quality weapons and armor, as well as better-trained soldiers. In a sense, they were more of the elite infantry of Mordor. The Haradrim used bows; far superior to Orc bows, they could deal some heavy damage to enemy units, even ones on horseback. The Haradrim also had Mûmakil, a huge, elephant-like beast which were like a walking tower which could deal huge damage.

<53>The other allies were the Variags of Khand, and the Corsairs of Umbar, who had the longest history of War with Gondor.

## **Captains and champions**

<53>The Nazgûl were deadly shadow-wraiths that could spread terror in their foes and were Sauron's primary captains. The Mouth of Sauron was a Black Númenórean sorcerer who served as Sauron's ambassador. Gothmog was the "lieutenant" of Minas Morgul, and took over after the Witch-king was struck down at the Pelennor Fields.

<53>Grishnákh was a captain of Barad-dûr, and he led the Orc-band from Mordor that was to meet Saruman's Uruk band that had captured Merry and Pippin. In those scenes, there are skirmishes between Grishnákh's authority and Uglúk's, who would only follow Saruman's orders, not Sauron's. The Orc-band from Mordor was mostly made up of Snaga Orcs.

<53>Other Orc captains, such as Shagrat and Gorbag, kept their unruly underlings in line—but required strong leadership themselves lest they go "rogue." Shagrat was a Black Uruk, loyal to Sauron, while Gorbag was from Minas Morgul, and the two had, or at least caused, a big fight at the Tower of Cirith Ungol, which ended up in all its garrison being killed, although Shagrat successfully got away with Frodo's mithril shirt, and he brought it to Barad-dûr, to Sauron.
