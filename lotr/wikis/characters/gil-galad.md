<53>Gil-galad, born Artanáro, was a Ñoldorin Elf and son to Orodreth. He was the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, and bore many titles, including High King of the Elves of the West, King of the Eldar, King of Lindon, Lord of the High Elves, and the Lord of Eriador.

<53>Gil-galad held the highest authority among the Elves he ruled and was respected by both the Ñoldor and the Sindar, thus being considered a "High King" of Elves in Middle-earth. He formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men alongside King Elendil, and led the Elves to war against Sauron during this time. His death marked the end of the Ñoldorin Kingdoms in Middle-earth, though some Ñoldor would still dwell in Imladris and the Grey Havens throughout the Third Age.

# History
---

## **First Age**

<53>Gil-galad was born in YT 1481 in Eldamar as the son of Orodreth and grandson of Angrod and Eldalótë, thus tying him into the House of Finarfin. He was still relatively young during the times of the Exile of the Ñoldor and such battles as Dagor Bragollach and Nírnaeth Arnoediad. His father ruled Minas Tirith on Tol Sirion, but shortly before its fall by the forces of Sauron, Orodreth send his wife and son to the Havens of the Falas into Círdan the Shipwright's care. Gil-galad lived there until Morgoth destroyed the Havens after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and Gil-galad and Círdan escaped to the Isle of Balar with the rest of the Falathrim.

<53>After the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Ñoldor. When the Sons of Fëanor committed the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking of the Havens of Sirion, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Fëanorians, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told him of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the remaining Sons of Fëanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed suicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his ranks as his herald, after the latter chose to be one of Elf-kind.

## **Second Age**

<53>In year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and established a realm in Lindon, which was geographically strong and secure against enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains and the western parts of Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar remained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.

<53>Gil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with Tar-Aldarion (the Mariner), The Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned as High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Age. During this time Gil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn, or Mallorn, trees by Tar-Aldarion, King of Númenor. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she left Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in Lindórinand. When they grew there it was renamed Laurelindórenan, Lórien of Blossom. At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were approached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad perceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that they should shun this stranger.

<53>However Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how to make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct, as Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted by Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya (Ring of Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald Elrond and his lieutenant Círdan prior to his demise in the War of the Last Alliance.

<53>Sauron invaded Eriador in great force in the War of the Elves and Sauron, destroying Eregion and laying siege to the Grey Havens. But Gil-galad was aided by the Númenóreans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, who sent a great fleet which defeated the Dark Lord's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the Dúnedain. Over a thousand years later Sauron was again confronted by the Númenóreans and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to rule Middle-earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew to the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of Númenor. Yet the survivors of Númenor, known as the The Faithful, arrived in Middle-Earth and established the Realms in Exile, with Gil-galad befriending the High King Elendil and building for him the three towers on the Tower Hills. A century later when Sauron attacked Gondor, Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel as to how they should deal with him. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his strength, forming the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.

<53>The two kings spent several years training and assembling their forces before meeting at Amon Sûl. Crossing the Misty Mountains they were joined by Oropher of the Greenwood, Amdír of Lórien and Durin IV of Khazad-dûm. Gil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos - which meant "Icicle"; none could withstand it. Joining up with the army of Gondor led by Anárion, the Army of the Last Alliance confronted Sauron's forces in the Battle of Dagorlad, a long and bloody battle which ultimately resulted in victory for the Alliance. The Elves and Men then passed through into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years.

<53>Eventually Sauron emerged and Gil-galad and Elendil then duelled the Dark Lord. During their struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on the Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the Dark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from "the heat of Sauron's hand", and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor ended in Middle-earth and Círdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey Havens and Lindon.

# Etymology

<53>Gil-galad was Sindarin for "Star of Radiance", from gil ("star") and galad ("light, radiance").

<53>His name in Quenya was Artanáro, which means "High Flame". In Sindarin, Artanáro translates to Rodnor.

<53>It was first conceived that Gil-galad's birth name was Ereinion instead of his epessë. Ereinion means "Son of Kings", from erain ("kings") and ion ("son").
