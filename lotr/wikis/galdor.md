# History
---

<53>Nothing is known of Galdor's early life except for that he probably lived with Cirdan the Shipwright in the Grey Havens for an unknown period of time.

<53>In the autumn of TA 3018, Galdor was sent by Círdan to Rivendell on an errand. On October 25, he attended the Council of Elrond. He asked for proof from Gandalf that the Ring Frodo bore was indeed the One Ring of Sauron, and he wanted to know what Saruman's opinion was. Gandalf then told his story of learning the truth about the Ring and his imprisonment by Saruman. When Tom Bombadil was mentioned, Galdor agreed that Tom could not keep the Ring safe, and he wondered whether it could be kept safe at Rivendell or the Havens or Lothlórien or anywhere else. In addition, when the possibility of casting the Ring into the Sea was considered, Galdor warned that Sauron would closely watch the road west and the Ringwraiths would return.
