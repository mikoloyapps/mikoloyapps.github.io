# History
---

<53>Írimë was born during the Noontide of Valinor, probably in Tirion. She was the third child of Finwë and Indis and their second daughter. Little is known about her except that she joined the Rebellion of the Ñoldor and went to Middle-earth with Fingolfin and his host.

<53>Írimë's fate is unknown; she may have been slain in one of the Battles of Beleriand. She could not have returned to Valinor before the end of the First Age, since none of the Ñoldor could return there due to the Doom of Mandos.

# Etymology

---

<53>The roots and meaning of the name Írimë are unspecified. Her mother-name was Lalwendë, or in shortened form, Lalwen, by which she was generally known. Lalwendëis Quenya, meaning "laughing maiden". It appears to me made of the words lala ("laugh") and the feminine term wendë ("maiden").

<53>In some writings, she was Irien, which may have been her father-name. It is possible that both "Írimë" and "Irien" had origins in the Quenya words írissë and írë ("desire") or perhaps írima ("lovely, desirable").
