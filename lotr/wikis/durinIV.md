#### Owain Arthur portrays Durin IV in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

<53>Durin IV was the descendant of the previous three kings to be named Durin, and like them was considered by many to be the reincarnation of Durin I, resembling him greatly in manner and appearance. He bore the ring of power given to his ancestor Durin III, and may have been ruling as king during the War of the Last Alliance.
