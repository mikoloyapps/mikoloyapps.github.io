<53>The **wraith-world** was the unseen realm in which cursed spirits such as the Ringwraiths had form.

# History
---

<53>The One Ring could draw any Ring-bearer to the wraith-world, allowing its denizens to be fully seen. It allowed the bearer to utilize strange powers and heightened olfactory and auditory senses. Any wraith within the realm would see the Ring-bearer, and vice versa, and the bearer could be subjected to that world's weapons, such as the Morgul-blade. Additionally, upon wearing the Ring, the bearer would turn invisible to all except for the wraiths themselves, and the Dark Lord, Sauron.

<53>Those who were in the Wraith-world could also see the brilliant, shining form of the High Elves known to exist in the other side of the threshold of the Unseen: Frodo Baggins saw Glorfindel in this form while wounded by the Morgul-blade.
