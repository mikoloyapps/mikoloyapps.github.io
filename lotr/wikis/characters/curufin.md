<53>**Curufin**, also called **Curufin the Crafty**, was a Ñoldorin prince and the fifth of the seven Sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel. Curufin was the father of Celebrimbor, master Jewel-smith of Eregion who would later forge the three Elvish Rings of Power.

<53>Among his seven brothers, Curufin was his father's favorite and was most like his father in skill of hand and in appearance.

# History
---

<53>Curufin was born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. There he married an unnamed Elf (most likely one of the Ñoldor) and had a son they named Celebrimbor, who would later follow Curufin to exile. As with all the Elves of Aman, they lived in peace and prosperity until the release of Melkor, the murder of Finwë and the theft of the Silmarils that led to the Exile of the Ñoldor.

<53>As with the other Sons of Fëanor, Curufin was bound by an oath to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Morgoth. His oath took him and his brothers to Middle-earth during the First Age.

<53>Arriving in Middle-earth, Fëanor roused Curufin and others who were most obedient to him, and set the swan-ships aflame. Later, Curufin and his brothers fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath but lost their father Fëanor in a subsequent ambush.

#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>Curufin and his older brother Celegorm (and possibly Celebrimbor) lived in Himlad, east of his brother Maedhros' fortress Himring and south of Aglon, a Pass between Himring and Dorthonion, leading into Doriath. Around this time, their cousin Aredhel left Gondolin in search for both sons of Fëanor. However, Curufin and Celegorm were not in their lands when she arrived, thus Aredhel left and traveled south and was lost in Nan Elmoth. Years later, Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth, and Eöl pursued them, only to be brought to Curufin. Though they had no love for him and scorned him, they did not slay him and allowed him to continue on his way.

<53>The two brothers fortified their realms with great strength and held them until the Dagor Bragollach. However, following the battle, the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people to Nargothrond, where Finrod welcomed them.

<53>Shortly after, Beren also came to Nargothrond to remind Finrod of the oath he had sworn, and claim his help. Finrod decided to help Beren, but Celegorm and Curufin, remembering their Oath, persuaded the people of Nargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth, making them fearful. Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of warriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew Orodreth was left to rule in his stead, but real power rested with Celegorm and Curufin.

<53>He and his brother went hunting with Celegorm's hound Huan, then found Lúthien, daughter of Thingol, as she fled to find Beren. Feigning to help her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for Celegorm had become enamoured and would have Thingol give him her hand. However, Huan helped Lúthien to flee, and they freed Beren and other thralls from Sauron. As these thralls returned, bearing news of the death of Finrod, the people of Nargothrond perceived the two brothers' treachery, and though Orodreth would not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond.

<53>The two brothers met Lúthien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought with Beren losing the knife Angrist in the struggle. Defeated, he had to flee with Celegorm, but sought to slay Lúthien even as he did, and shot Beren instead.

<53>Due to Celegorm and Curufin's deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would lend no aid to Maedhros as he sought to unite Elves, Dwarves, and Men in what was called the Union of Maedhros.

<53>Curufin fell in the Second Kinslaying, when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize the Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King Dior. His brothers Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during the assault.

# Etymology

---

<53>His father-name was Curufinwë, meaning "Skilled (son of) Finwë" from the Quenya curu ("Skill"). The name Curufinwë is also Fëanor's original name. This was because Curufin was most like his father in appearance, temperament, and skill. His mother-name is Atarinkë ("Little Father") for he resembled his father in both mind and talent. He was called Kurvo by his family members.
