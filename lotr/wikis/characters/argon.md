# History
---

<53>Argon was therefore the last child and the third son of Fingolfin and Anairë who was also of the Ñoldor. Argon was the younger brother of Fingon, Turgon, and Aredhel his elder sister. He was most likely born in Tirion during the Years of the Trees. He was described to be the tallest of his brothers and most impetuous. He followed his father through Helcaraxë and set foot on Middle-earth during the First Age. During the Battle of Lhammoth, Argon hewed a path through the foes and killed the Orc captain, before he himself was slain.

<53>Argon was less than 1381 years old when he was killed - a young age for an Elf. His death was the first signs of the Doom of Mandos.

# Etymology

<53>Arakáno thus never received a true Sindarin name, but Argon was later devised for him in the records. It is recorded that this later became a popular name under the Eldar. His Quenya name was Arakáno ("High Commander"), named so partially for his character.
