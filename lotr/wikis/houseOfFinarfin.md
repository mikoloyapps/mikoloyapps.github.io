#### The Children of Finarfin

<53> The **House of Finarfin** was a noble house of Ñoldorin Elves.

# History
---

<53>The house was founded by Finarfin, son of Finwë, after his marriage to Eärwen, daughter of Olwë, in YT 1280. The couple had four (or five) children: Finrod, (Orodreth), Aegnor, Angrod, and Galadriel. During the Revolt of the Ñoldor, Finarfin and his household followed the House of Fëanor into exile. The Kinslaying at Alqualondë made Finarfin reluctant to journey further. At last, at the proclamation of the Doom of Mandos, Finarfin repented and turned back to Aman where he sued for pardon from the Valar. He returned, but his children did not come, which led to the foundation of the House of Finrod in Middle-earth. In Aman, the High Kingship of the Elves was passed to Finarfin.

<53>The House is recognizable by the golden hair of its members due to their half-Vanyarin heritage from Finarfin's mother, Indis.
