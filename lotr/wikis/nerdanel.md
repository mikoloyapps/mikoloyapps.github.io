#### Nerdanel with her sons Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin (unborn)

<53>After marrying Fëanor, Nerdanel bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod and Amras.

<53>Unlike her husband, she was of a peaceful nature and sought to moderate his fiery temper and pride with wisdom. For a time, she was the only one able to influence him.

#### Nerdanel, with father Mahtan and future husband Fëanor

<53>Nerdanel refused to follow her husband to Middle-earth, and their parting was not a happy one. When it became clear that he intended to leave Valinor for good, she came to him and pleaded with him to let her youngest sons, Amrod and Amras, remain with her. Fëanor would hear nothing of it and accused her of being against him and in league with the Valar, namely Aulë. He stated that the sons wished to follow and obey their father; if she did not follow him she would be abandoning all of their children. She then scorned him saying that he would not have them all and then she left, possibly retiring to her father's house in Aman. By refusing to join her husband in revolt, Nerdanel avoided the Doom of Mandos, though her sons did not. The last remnant of her family to die was her grandson Celebrimbor, the forger of the three Elven Rings of Power in the second age.
