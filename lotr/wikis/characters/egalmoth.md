# History

<53>Egalmoth, along with Glorfindel and Ecthelion, was Aredhel's escort when she left Gondolin in search of the Sons of Fëanor. The escort was not admitted into Doriath and traveled to Ered Gorgoroth instead. Egalmoth and his companions were separated from Aredhel and when they could not find her, they returned to Gondolin empty-handed.

## **Fall of Gondolin**

<53>Egalmoth was the wealthy Lord of the House of the Heavenly Arch. He defended the realm with valor but after the fall of the gate he was forced to flee, but not before gathering survivors. Before their escape through Idril's Secret Way, he and Tuor fought the enemy in the Square. When it was clear that the situation was hopeless, he escaped via the Secret Way, thus surviving the Fall of Gondolin. He fled to the Mouths of Sirion with fellow survivors, and later died in the attack by the Sons of Fëanor.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Egalmoth has unclear origins, though it is likely to have been Sindarin. The first element egal has many possibilities to its origin, including eglerio or egleria ("praise, glorify"), egnas (which is rather appropriately found in both Ñoldorin and Sindarin), or êg ("sharp point"), eglon or eglir (which were names given to the Ñoldor by the Sindar), or egol ("forsaken"). The second component of 'Egalmoth' is likely to have come from the Sindarin word moth ("dusk").
