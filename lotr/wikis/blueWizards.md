> *"Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion... and after his first fall to search out his hiding and to cause dissension and disarray among the dark East... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of the East... who both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have... outnumbered the West."*
>> \- J.R.R. Tolkien

<53>The **Blue Wizards** (or the **Ithryn Luin**) were two mysterious characters of Middle-earth, named as such because they both wore sea-blue robes.

#### The Blue Wizards journeying to the East

> *"I think that they went as emissaries to distant regions, east and south... Missionaries to enemy occupied lands as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and "magic" traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron."*
>> \- J.R.R. Tolkien

<53>The existence of five Wizards is only mentioned briefly in The Lord of the Rings. In J.R.R. Tolkien's Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age it is told that aside from Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast, there were "others of the Istari who went into the east of Middle-earth, and do not come into these tales." Tolkien also writes in Unfinished Tales that the two Wizards were sent to the East whose names were "Alatar" and "Pallando". Alatar was a Maia of the Vala Oromë who chose him to go to Middle-earth. Alatar asked his friend Pallando to join him on his mission.

<53>The time that the Blue Wizards arrived in Middle-earth is uncertain. In Unfinished Tales, Tolkien wrote that the five Istari came to Middle-earth together in TA 1000. However, in The Peoples of Middle-earth, they are said to have arrived in the Second Age, around the year SA 1600, the time of the forging of the One Ring. Their mission was directed at weakening Sauron's forces in the eastern and southern parts of Middle-earth, whereas the other Istari were focused on the west.

#### The two Blue Wizards Alatar and Pallando

<53>It is also uncertain whether they failed in their mission, but it seems most likely. In Unfinished Tales Tolkien writes that, "indeed of all the Istari, one only remained faithful," referring to Gandalf. Also in letter 211, he said, "what success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; I suspect that they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron". However, in a text found in The Peoples of Middle-earth, alternate set of names are given, Morinehtar and Rómestámo (or Rome(n)star), "Darkness-slayer" and "East-helper". It is not clear whether these names were intended to be replacements for Alatar and Pallando, or whether they had a second set of names (for instance, their names used in Middle-earth).

# Etymology

---

<53>The name "Alatar" probably means "after-comer" (as he was one of the original two Maiar to be chosen to become Wizards and follow Sauron to Middle-earth). J.R.R. Tolkien specifically stated that neither Alatar nor Pallando had a name in the west of Middle-earth, unlike the other Wizards.

<53>Later in his life, Tolkien wrote a note suggesting that the names of the Blue Wizards were Morinehtar and Rómestámo. It is not clear whether these names were intended to replace the names Alatar and Pallando, or whether Morinehtar and Rómestámo were alternate names for the Blue Wizards, possibly those given to them by the peoples of Middle-earth.

<53>The name "Morinehtar" means "darkness-slayer." The name "Rómestámo" means "East-helper," from the Quenya word romen, meaning uprising, sunrise, east.
