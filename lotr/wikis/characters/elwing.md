#### Galadriel in Aman

<53>When the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family was either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as well as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of Sirion.

<53>It was at the Havens that Elwing met Eärendil and later married him. She bore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elros became the first King of Númenor and was the ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar. Elrond later went on to marry Lady Celebrían, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of Lothlórien. From this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and Elrohir, twin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor. Elwing was forced to abandon her children when the Sons of Fëanor came for the Silmaril in Elwing's possession. Rather than give it over, she threw herself into the Sea and was transformed into a great white bird by the Vala Ulmo.

<53>She flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the Vingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they chose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final plea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth.

<53>When they arrived, Elwing chose to accompany her husband onto the shores, even though she knew it might mean her death. While Eärendil journeyed to visit the Valar, Elwing walked the shores, eventually meeting the Teleri of Alqualondë, her kin through her great-grandfather Thingol. There, she told them the tale of what was happening in Middle-earth and became much loved by them.

<53>The Valar eventually agreed to go to war to aid those in Middle-earth, and also decided to give both Eärendil and Elwing the choice of which kindred they would belong. Eärendil, out of respect for his wife, allowed her to choose for the both of them. She chose to be counted among the Elves, in honor of her foremother, Lúthien.

<53>A white tower was later built for Elwing where she could live. It was also said that the birds taught her their language and that she would fly to meet Eärendil when he returned from his nightly voyages.

# Etymology

---

<53>The name Elwing means "Star-foam", from the Sindarin el ("star") and wing ("foam, spray").
