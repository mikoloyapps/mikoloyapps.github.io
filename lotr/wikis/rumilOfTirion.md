<53>**Rúmil** was a knowledgeable loremaster of the Ñoldor living in the city of Tirion, in Valinor.

# History
---

<53>Rúmil was possibly born in Valinor, or was perhaps one of the firstborn Elves. He thrived in Valinor, being the first to invent the art of writing down words with pen or brush on many different mediums: he invented the alphabet called Sarati (each letter being a Sarat). This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor as the Tengwar. Rúmil was also a skilled linguist, and when the Teleri finally arrived in Valinor he was first to discover just how the Telerin language had changed from Common Eldarin compared to Quenya. He became part of an Elvish culture of loremasters known as the Lambengolmor.

<53>When the Ñoldor determined to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, Rúmil was among those who refused the summons of Fëanor, remaining in Tirion as one of the Ñoldor of Finarfin.

# Etymology
