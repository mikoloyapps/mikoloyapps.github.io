# History

<53>Lindir was a listener at one of Bilbo's poetry readings at Rivendell. He may have been a minstrel as implied by his name. After Bilbo finished reciting the Song of EÃ¤rendil, Lindir said he could not tell which parts Aragorn wrote and what parts were written by Bilbo, because all mortals seem alike to Elves.

# Etymology
