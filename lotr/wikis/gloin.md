## **Early Life**

![](gloin/2.jpg)

#### Glóin, as portrayed by Peter Hambleton

<53>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin.

<53>In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

<53>In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

#### Gloin and Oin

<53>In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture it from the dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Glóin also fought in the Battle of Five Armies. After the battle, he made his home in the Lonely Mountain.

## **War of the Ring**

<53>On October 25, 3018, Glóin and his son Gimli attended the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he greeted Frodo Baggins at the welcome dinner, after Frodo had recovered from his wound received from the Witch-king of Angmar. He recounted the history of the Lonely Mountain and the Kingdom of Dale since Bilbo had left, including Balin's decision to leave the Lonely Mountain and re-establish the ancient Dwarven kingdom in Moria. At the Council of Elrond, his son Gimli warned of the messengers from Mordor who had been threatening King Dáin II Ironfoot, seeking news of Bilbo, Frodo, and the One Ring. It is unknown whether Glóin fought against Sauron's forces in the Battle of Dale.

## **Later Life**

<53>Glóin died in FO 15 at the age of 253.
