<53>The **Morgul-knife** was a short blade carried by the Witch-king of Angmar during the Third Age, and used to stab Frodo Baggins at the ancient watch-tower of Weathertop.

# Description
---

<53>It is unknown if there was more than one Morgul-knife, as only that used by the Witch-king is mentioned in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Elrond, however, references the blade as "a Morgul-knife", possibly implying it to be a type of weapon.

<53>Alternately described as a long knife and a blade, it was used by the Nazgûl to poison enemies. As explained by Elrond, the purpose of the knife was to break off in the wound, leaving a shard in the victim's body. The remaining blade would soon turn to dust, and the shard works its way through the body to the heart. If the shard of the blade stays in the victim for too long, the victim becomes a wraith.

# History
---

<53>It is unknown when the knife was created, but was known to be in use by the Witch-king by the late Third Age.

<53>On October 6 TA 3018, the Witch-king used the knife to stab Frodo Baggins at Weathertop, during the Nazgûl's attack upon him and his companions. Though the knife's blade dissolved soon afterwards, a fragment remained within Frodo's wound, working its way toward his heart and threatening to turn Frodo into a wraith. Elrond was able to remove the shard and heal the wound, but each year on the anniversary of receiving the wound Frodo became seriously ill. Only his eventual departure to Valinor, also known as the Undying Lands, offered a permanent cure.

<53>Athelas (or Kingsfoil) was known to slow the poisonous effect of the Morgul-blade, though true healing was necessary in order to fully cure a victim. This remedy was also known to heal the effects of the Ringwraiths' Black Breath.
